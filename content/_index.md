# I'm Tomas Koutsky
a self-taught software developer; currently, I write code in [Metaphysic](https://metaphysic.ai/).

Besides that, I, of course, have some side projects (slooowly) going on, namely:
* [Mathematics interpreter](https://github.com/stepnivlk/matika)
* [Git in Rust](https://github.com/stepnivlk/rit)
* [STEM BSc course at the Open University](categories/uni/)

In those rare moments when I don't stare at a screen, I like to [hike](categories/hiking/), [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4651959) and [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67551704-tomas-koutsky).
