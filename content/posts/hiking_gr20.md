# Day 0 - Arrival
![d0](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329726063_2ae5b97922_c.jpg)

I arriving to the [Calvi](https://en.mapy.cz/s/jecazulapa) - very rural airport, there were herds of goats and small fields everywhere around. Horizon was filled with mountains, there were thick clouds forming over them. It was warm and dump, in very tropical way.

I had a big of a problem, I didn't have any physical money. See, there were 5 ATMs in Paris CDG - my layover, I had some time to spare there so I was planning to get a cash there. However, all of the ATMs were out of order. Usually with a printed memo promising that the other ATM around the corner will definitely give out some $$.
Fortunatelly there was one (working) ATM right at the airport.

I unwrapped solidly wrapped backpack, the scrap plastic was like a footbal :(.

Took short cab ride to a camp in [Calenzana](https://en.mapy.cz/s/gurahosude) which is the starting town of GR20.
There were tens of hikers preparing their own hikes. GR20 seemed to not be an introvert-friendly hike.
At least that was my initial thought, For the following text it's important to state that I can only say bonjour in french.

In Calenzana, I started with pitching a tent, it was new and I didn't know exactly how, you know how it goes with manuals :). But hey it's not a rocket scince. Then I was simly settling in, talking with other hikers, mostly about gear.

I brushed my teeth with pimped-up half-toothbrush and superconcentrated outdoor paste.
After that I threw the paste to tent to deal with it later.
Then more chats with fellow hikers but my eyes started to close.
So I sat into the tent to orginize my stuff before the sleep.
Suddenly there was a fire ... on my ass? I got up just to find I sat to the most concentrated toothpaste which I smudged everywhere. It was all over my only one shorts, expensive cuben-fiber tent floor...
Fortunatelly tent seemed ok, 30mins in shover sorted out the shots, ass was still on fire though.
It was like 30*C outside and as true ultralighter I didn't even had any spare underwear, just those shorts with integrated ones. So I got to the sleep half-naked :).

Big thunderstorm awoke whole camp at 2 A.M. It got me up some time before, I was just listening to this rumbling over the sea with massive soundstage slowly closing on the land.
Ligthnings blink every second, it rained like crazy. There were streams of water forming bellow all around.
Given it was dump even before the storm and I was all wet from my toothpaste party there was solid condensation on the walls of my tent. And in combination with raindrops bashing the tent on the outside it created a rain in the inside too. So now I had even the sleeping back wet.


# Day 1 - Calenzana -> Refuge de Carozzu | 19.88 km; 2,300m up; 1,298m down

Storm got over us around 7 A.M., obviously I didn't sleep much. So I slowly packed the stuff and got going. Everything I had was wet, there was mud inside of my shoes.
Also I really need to learn how to properly pitch that damn tent, all the guilines lost the tension.

At 9, after some wasted efforts to dry out the gear I finally got going... To the shop.
But after that I found myself at the official start. Plenty of people starting, everyone was, of course, taking photos. But after this ritual we quickly broke up and I got some alone-time.

It was windy.

Locally rainy.

The trail went constantly uphill, I had to climb around 1600m to the first refuge.
During the morning the weather improved

And clouds gave space to views
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330574752_2b1040520c_c.jpg)

Around the lunchtime I arrived to [Refuge de lÂ´Ortu di u Piobbu](https://en.mapy.cz/s/popevejaje), got Coke and some musli to the system and started to think about what next. Other hikers were already washing themselves and pitching their tents. Way to early. I asked the hutmaster what's the next stage like, he didn't understand much, had to use hands and some other hiker. I think the answer was more or less same as previous one.

![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330402281_c6aa9a4118_c.jpg)

I didn't believe that, from the map it seemed like a short climb to seddle and bit of a fall to the next hut. So I drank 1.5l of water at the spring and got up the hill.


The trail indeed started with the climb to the seddle
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329730533_112fbcfc04_c.jpg)
However, then it continued with long, technical ridge walk with endless ups and downs
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329731218_e8645ddab4_c.jpg)
Some loose rocks and scrambling
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329731963_6369942e3f_c.jpg)
Somewhere around here I met this older guy with much younger pair. I thought maybe father taking kids on hike or unkle? So I dabbed them Unkle and the Kids(tm). They hiked in my pace, I got to talk with unkle here and there. But the kids didn't speak a word in english and they mostly ignored me. Found out they aren't related, just random people on the trail.

In one of those more technical passages we met another guy who looked like he's gonna have total breakdown every second. He was just standing there, kept telling us he's ok but refused to move. We didn't know what to do, so we left him there, if he say's he's ok...
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330405141_37427f1975_c.jpg)
Way down out of the ridge was very long, steep and energy-taking. A lot of loose rocks with scrambling passages here and there. Down in the valley streams started to pop up, I filtered some water, unkle just drank it directly.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330405496_c983baf5b4_c.jpg)
We arrived to the refuge totally destroyed, first thing first - beer.
Uncle and the Kids don't have tent nor any booking, the hutmaster looked like he's gonna send them to the wild. Then he told me there's just one spot for my little tent - next to the rubbish bins.

Then usual rituals, I cooked on the alcohol stove for the first time, I really hoped I won't burn the place to the ground.

# Day 2 - Refuge de Carozzu -> Ascu | 5.01km; 816m up; 668m down
<iframe src='https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/embed/5472918099' title='GR20 Day 2' width='465' height='500' frameborder='0'></iframe>

I got up in the middle of night totally cold. Found out my mattress was totally deflated so I inflated it, got to the sleep ... and this repated 3 more times. So I got a puncture probably even before the first night on the trail. And I got second night without good sleep and counting.

![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329731588_e698ced49c_c.jpg)

Got somehow going but didn't feel well (obviously), the plan was to get to the next hut, sort out the mat, get sleep and be good & happy. And that's really a over-the-hill hike.

As I was approaching the seddle it got cold and I had to take the long sleeve for the first (and last) time. There was thick mist on the other side of ridge, visibility was to the nearest rock.
So I was just mindlessly falling down... through the technical terrain, so I broke my knee. Some blood was pumping out, so I rubbet it of with Buff here and there.

At 2 (P.M.) I reached Asco, broke gipsy-style camp, just to dry out everything on the sun.
Met the Unkle and the Kids, they obviously continued. Wished them luck, I had mat to fix.
The only problem was I didn't have a repair kit but at first I had to find the puncture.
Tried to put it into the brook but the water was to restless.

At the therm-a-rest site I read the best approach is to smudge the mat with soup water.
Damn, who they think I am, some sort of holywood super model? I didn't have such an item in my inventory.
So I went around the camp asking for soup, got one, smudged the hell out of it but didn't find the puncture.
What now? I didn't want to go shopping to the city. So I bought a beer, then second one.
Then I invented this sort of a nest, pulled out padded back from backpack, got together all the (packed, not naked this time) clothes I had, placed it bellow the mat. This meant ~2hrs of good sleep on nest + mat and some hrs of bad sleep in bare nest, hopefully limiting reinflate operations during night. That could work.

I still felt quite out of my skin, also I had really high resting HR, around 100BPM, basically the same as when walking.

Then I just hang out and had some chats with fellow hikers.
Cooked some meal, left packed stove in vestibulle of the tent and went asleep.


# Day 3 | 1.9. 2020 | Ascu -> Castel de Vergio | 23.51 km; 2,021m up; 1,298m
<iframe src='https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/embed/5472954644' title='GR20 Day 3' width='465' height='500' frameborder='0'></iframe>

First time cold awoke me was at 3:30 so nest really helped but I got cold anyway :(. HR was still at 100BPM. I inflated the mat and fell asleep.

I got awake again at 4:30, this time not because of the mat. There was an attack to my tent, I heard this quick, sneaky movement sound and then just sad jingle of my stove moving away. So probably a fox took it away, but whyyyy? I cleaned it precisely after lunch. Then I remembered I kept a pack of outdoor coffee in it so the fox was probably up to it. 
So I was laying there, in the nest, relatively exhausted thinking if I should pack my stuff and go sit on some beach instead of this chain of disasters. Well, anyway I got up to chase the thief.
After a bit of uphill climb in the bushes I found the stove! Stuffsack was on pieces but there was just single bite in the coffe, it wasn't good enough or what?

So I cleand up the mess, got back to nest but wasn't able to fall asleep, this was my very bottom of whole trail, wanted to give up.

Then, somewhat mechanically, I packed the gear and hit the trail as usual. I thought screw it, what other disaster can happen?
This stage was no joke though, there was climb to the ridges of Mt. Cinto ahead of me. Basically 1188m of ascent in one go. At the beginning HR was, of course, at 100BPM.
<iframe style="border:none" src="https://en.frame.mapy.cz/s/jorojenuru" width="400" height="280" frameborder="0"></iframe>


So I put some music in my ears and got going. Sun was shining behind the ridge, the air was crisp and cristal clear. The promise of nice day in the mountains.

![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330579892_0ee75b6029_c.jpg)


The landscape was nicely mountaineous, sparkled with medditerean vegetation here and there.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330406826_086efc3e77_c.jpg)

At this point I started to feel like I'm in the best place I could possibly be and started to fully enjoy the hike.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330581152_bed440396d_c.jpg)
Got in a serious flow, flew up the hill like nothing.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330581547_1935208abe_c.jpg)
On the top I just hang out a bit and continued with quite technical scramble on the ridge.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330582072_965805f5b1_c.jpg)

Then free fall through massive loose scree slope.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330582902_3f37d9fa91_c.jpg)

When I was getting ahead of one colleague I told him I don't feel comfortable on those loose rocks, especially after my recent hiking incident.

Then we met this group of guys who were racing downhill against each other and I was like screw it and joined them. We mostly ran, and I totally forgot about what I was saying couple of moments ago.

![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330583317_647b798b9d_c.jpg)


Down in the valley we had to scramble all the time, I didn't think much.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330583702_3664e94939_c.jpg)

I just had tiny moments to decide which limb goes where. Really enjoyed this living-in-the-moment.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330583702_3664e94939_c.jpg)

Aaand I finished first. Had to cool down legs in a lagoon :).
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330410116_f22f4750de_c.jpg)

I ate lunch of champions on the first hut in the vally.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329737458_3e2aa96435_c.jpg)

On second I bought 400g of cheese, on both combined I drank 3l of water, sun is really starting to shine.

The plan was to get over one more ridge and combine two stages.
First it was easy valley walk but then the climb began. The sun was burning everything around. There are other hikers climbing and I constantly caught up with some of those, had some chats, usually they were pretty polite and wanted to let me go ahead, but that's like a obligation to move faster and loose them for a bit... And I was pretty much destroyed even before the climb...

At least there were clouds pushing from the other side of the ridge.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329737768_1a26509b46_c.jpg)
The way slowly falled down into this amazing remote valley.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330585272_257703f57e_c.jpg)
Down.

To the forrest.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330586252_3994af4feb_c.jpg)
Where I broke a pole in between some roots like nothing. Damn these ultralight tinfoils...
The thing is I need at least one pole to pitch the tent and by this experiment I figured it's not quite hard to break one. So I decided to carry broken one for spare parts. Like an antenna on backpack.

However, it made me realised that I was basically half-dead, didn't sleep properly for god knows how long and just hiked over the most demanding section of GR20. I sat down and ate whole cheese I bought before, just like that without anything else. Then the walk went much better.

To the refuge I arrived very much wretched but with a feeling of a day lived through at 100%. Falling asleep was a matter of seconds, nest wasn't a problem this time.


# Day 4 | 2.9. 2020 | Castel de Vergio -> Petra Piana | 26.32 km; 1,577m up; 1,140m
<iframe src='https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/embed/5477148603' title='GR20 Day 4' width='465' height='500' frameborder='0'></iframe>

I had to reinflate only two times over the night. But still I had to desperatelly improve quality of sleep. And for that I hatched a plan - on the next refuge I wil try to cadge some of their spare mats. For this purpose, my amazing girlfriend sent me this manual how to talk with frenchpeople:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/Jnq5T39.jpg)

Today it all started with grassy mushy landscape, it felt so restorative against beaten feet.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329740243_b248c42e34_c.jpg)
It looked like from Lord of the Rings dashed with a bit of Death Stranding.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329740588_644b7fab41_c.jpg)
So I listened to its soundtrack and felt like Sam Porter Bridges. My load of 7kg felt a bit pathetic though.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330587642_8cee07ae78_c.jpg)

I ate a lunch at the refuge Manganu, coke and piece of chockolate. Checked the weather with hutmaster, all good so I had no excuse to continue.
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330588532_9d186af062_c.jpg)
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329742238_2c9d01fe88_c.jpg)

This stage was amazing but very tough. You basically scramble around glacial lakes 500m above them, all very airy. I got toghet with two guys here, french of course so we were discussing using thumbs but we were like some elite hiking unit flying through the trail for some time. And the trail was demanding, scrambles everywhere, moraine fields... I broke the other knee, soke it up with buff again.


When we arrived to the refuce I interestingly felt quite good. Went to hutmaster to try to borrow the mat and it went followingly:

- "Hi, sorry I don't speak frech, is english ok?"
- "Meh"
- "Can I pitch my tent in here?"
- "You want to rent a tent?"
- "No, I have my tent" I point to myself.
- "Ok, 8E"
- "And can I ask you, I punctured my matress, would it be possible to borrow one of yours?"
- "You broke your tent?"
- "No, my matress broken", I show a cross with my hands.
- "Ehh?"
- "My tapi de mus broken", I show the manual my girlfriend sent me.
- "Oh your tapidemu, no problem, see that guy in red shirt? Ask him."

So I had to repeate same conversation but in the end I got a mat! Hooray.

I also picked great place to pitch a tent, near this big rock I called workbench, in a minute my whole backpack exploded there :).
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50329747273_a92aacd46d_c.jpg)

Given new month started this day I washed myself.

And again I felt asleep totally exhausted & happy.


# Day 5 | 3.9. 2020 | Petra Piana -> Vizzavona | 18.15 km; 1,058m up; 1,979m

It got really cold in the night but I regenerated much better on a real mat instead of nest. I was ready to go at 8:30. Actually that's my superability here, I'm usually glad when I start cooking a bit after 7.

Today, it all started with amazing ridgewalk, sometimes there was a bit of scramble but nothing serious as yesterday. It reminded me Carpathians.
Had lunch above the refuge Orba - snickers and then another big climb in the prime sun. Which made me soo slow and dizzy. I got to the ridge like a winner just to relise I had to fall 1000m down to the town of Vizzavona. Originally I didn't even want to stop there and go to the next stage righht away. However, there's a gossip going on on the trail that their cook pizza down there.
So in the town I indeed got pizza (and some beers of course), had some chats with fellow hikers. And started planning how much time it'll get to finish whole trail. I estimated 4 more days.

# Den 6 | 4.9. 2020 | Vizzavona -> Refuge de Prati | 34.84km; 2,064m up; 1,172m down 
<iframe src='https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/embed/5498019910' title='GR20 Day 6' width='465' height='500' frameborder='0'></iframe>

Today was fast day. It started with 1000m of very gentle climb through forrests. I arrived to a refuge around lunch time so I bought coke & omellete. I met some czech guys there so had an opportunity to chat in my native language. They had huge ~20kg backpacks, I wished them my condolences and got going.

Then I met the uncle from the uncle and the kids team but he lost the kids. So we exchanged trail stories. We split after a while but on common refuge of destination (and beer).

After that I had an opportunity to enjoy flat walk before final climb to a ridge.
Suddenly, the mountains are different now, everything is more open, grassy with big rocks here and there.

When I arrived to refuge it got even better. It was on top of a high plateau, with those new, fresh mountains all around, fluffy clouds flitted around peaks. And there was a panoramic view of a see 2km bellow us.

Had nice chat with hutmaster, borrowing a mat was easy job.

I cooked the dinner almost as a native:
![img](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50330607562_274c58e208_c.jpg)

Then just worthy sleep.


# Day 7 | 5.9. 2020 | Refuge de Prati -> Refuge d'Asinau | 28.95km; 1,935m up; 2,140m down
