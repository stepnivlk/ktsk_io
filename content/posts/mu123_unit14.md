# 1 Communicating clearly
## 1.1 Interpreting information about risk
**Probability**, **chance** or **risk** defines how likely is something to occur.

Probabilities can be expressed as fractions, decimals or percentages, or in the form of an $x$ in $y$ chance.

## 1.2 Interpreting graphs and charts
**Comparative bar chart** is a bar chart with tow or more bars for each data item.
**Pictogram** is a chart that conveys numerical information by means of pictures.

# 2 Extending your mathematical skills
## 2.1 Developing your equation-solving skills
### Using shortcuts
#### Cross-multiplying

$$
\frac{A}{B} = \frac{C}{D} \\\\[1em]
BD \times \frac{A}{B} = BD \times \frac{C}{D} \\\\[1em]
AD = BC
$$

## 2.2 Solving trigonometric equations
### Sines, cosines and tangents of related angles
In general, for any acute angle $\theta$ the for angles

$\theta$, $180^\circ-\theta$, $180^\circ+\theta$, $360^\circ-\theta$


all have the same sine, cosine and tangent, except for the signs.
The signs are determined by the sings that th $x$- and $y$-coordinates take in the different quadrats:
* In the first quadrant, $x$ and $y$ are both positive, so sine, cosine and tangent are all positive.
* In the second quadrant, $x$ is negative and $y$ is positive, so sine is positive and cosine is negative, and hence tangent is negative.
* In the third quadrant, $x$ and $y$ are both negative, so sine and cosine are both negative, and hence tangent is positive.
* In the fourth quadrant, $x$ is positive and $y$ is negative, so sine is negative and cosine is positive, and hence tangent is negative.

The sings can be remembered using **CAST**:

|S (Sin positive) |A (All positive) |
|--|--|
|T (Tan positive) |C  (Cos positive) | 

## 2.3 Finding the angle of inclination of a line
**Angle of inclination** of a line is its angle measured anticlockwise from the positive direction of the $x$-axis, when the line is drawn on a pair of axes with equal scales.

### Gradient and angle of inclination of a straight line
For any straight line with angle of inclination $\theta$,
$$
\text{gradient} = \tan \theta
$$
Remember that the angle of inclination is measured when the line is drawn on axes *with equal scales*.

## 4.2 Exploring sinusoidal functions
A curve that can be obtained from the graph of the sine function by shifting, stretching or compressing it horizontally or vertically is called a **sinusoidal curve**.
A function whose graph is sinusoidal curve is called a **sinusoidal function**.

**General sine functions** and **general cosine functions** are functions with roles of following forms:
$$
y = a \sin(b(x - c)) + d
$$
and
$$
y = a \cos (b(x + c)) + d
$$
where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are constants.

The $y$-values of any sinusoidal function *oscillates* between a minimum value and a maximum value and the shape of the graph is continually repeated.
**Period** of the graph is the length on the $x$-axis that it takes for the graph to repeat. Any section of the graph covering this length on the $x$-axis is referred to as an **oscillation**.

### The period of general sine or cosine function
The period of $y = a \sin(b(x - c)) + d$ or $y = a \cos (b(x + c)) + d$ is:
$$
\frac{2\pi}{|b|}
$$


### The graph of a general sine function
The graph of the equation 
$$
y = a \sin(b(x - c)) + d
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are positive, and $c$ and $d$ can take any values, has the following features.
* $a$ is the **amplitude**: the distance between the center line and the maximum (or minimum) value.
* $b$ determines the *period*, which is equal to $2\pi/b$.
* $c$ is the **horizontal displacement**: the amount that the graph of $y = a \sin (bx) + d$ is shifhted to the right to obtain the graph of $y = a \sin (b(x - c)) + d$. (The shift is to the left if $c$ is negative.)
* $d$ is the **vertical displacement**: the amount that the center line is shifted up from the $x$-axis. (The shift is down if $d$ is negative.)
* The minimum value is $d - a$ (the vertical displacement minus the amplitude)
* The maximum value is $d + a$ (the vertical displacement plus the amplitude)
