# 2 Expressions
## 2.1 What is an expression?
A collection of letters, numbers and/or mathematical symbols arranged in such a way that if numbers are substituted for the letters, then I can work out hte value of the expression.

> Letters represent numbers, so the normal rules of arithmetic apply to them.
> In exactly the same way as they apply to numbers.

In particular **BIDMAS** rules apply to the letters.

**Evaluation** is the process of substituting numbers for the letters.
**Equivalent** expresions are those that are same, just written differently
* e.g.: $x + x = 2x$

**Rearranging** is writing an expression in a different way.
**Simplifying** is rearranging in order to make the expression simpler.

Expressions *don't* contain equals sings. E.g.: $x + x = 2$ is an **equation**

> *bicause noe 2 thynges can be moare equalle.*
> -- Robert Recorde, the inventor of $=$

**Identities** are equations that are true for all values of the variables
* $\frac{3}{10}N = 150$ is not identity, it's currect for only one value of $N$.
*  $x + x = 2x$ is an identity.

**unknown** is a letter representing a particular number I don't know yet
* In $\frac{3}{10}N = 150$ the $N$ is unknown.

**variable** is a letter that represents *any* number
* In $x + x = 2x$ the $x$ is variable. 

## 2.2 What is a term?
The things that are added or subtracted in an expression.
E.g. in following expression:
$$
-2xy + 3z - y^2
$$
The $-2xy$, $+3z$, $-y^2$ are terms. Plus / minus signs are part of the term.
There's implicit plus in the front of an expression, e.g. $4a + c$ has following terms: $+4a$ and $+c$. When dicussing the terms the plus sign can be omitted alltogether.

> An expression is equivalent to the sum of its terms.

Order of terms can be changed since it doesn't matter when adding numbers.

**Constant** term is a number only, e.g. in $3a - 2$ the term $-2$ is constant.
**Coefficient** of a term is a number in a term of the $\text{a number} \times \text{a combination of letters}$ form, e.g. $2xy$ has coefficient $2$ and $2$ is a term in $xy$.

## 2.3 Collecting like terms
**Like terms** are terms that are 'batches of same thing'. Same thing means the letters and the powers of the letters in each term must be the same. E.g. $7\sqrt{A}$ and $3\sqrt{A}$ are like terms.
The lower- and upper-case versions of the same letter are *different* symbols.
Terms **cancel** each other out when the result of collecting those is zero.

# 3 Simplifying terms
## 3.1 Simplifying single terms.
Index notation should be used when simplifying a term with samel letters, e.g. $p \times p$ simplifies to $p^2$.

> Strategy
> 1. Find the overall sign.
> 2. Simplify the rest of the coefficient.
> 3. Write the letters in alphabetical order, use index notation.

## 3.2 Simplifying two or more terms
> **Strategy**
> 1. Identify the terms. Each term after the first starts with a plus or minus sign that isn't inside brackets.
> 2. Simplify each term. Include the sign (plus or minus) at the start of each term.
> 3. Collect any like terms

# 4 Brackets
## 4.1 Multiplying out brackets
Any expression containing brackets like:
$$
8a + 3b(b - 2a)
$$
can be rewritten without brackets by multiplying each term inside the brackets by the **multiplier** - $3b$ in the example:
$$
8a + 3b \times b - 3b \times 2a
$$

> **Strategy**
> To multiply out brackets in an expression with more than one term
> 1. Identify the terms. Each term after the first starts with a plus or minus sign that isn't inside brackets.
> 2. Multiply out the brackets in each term. Include the sign (plus or minus) at the start of each resulting term.
> 3. Collect any like terms.

> **Strategy**
> To remove brackets with a plus or minus sign in front
> * Inf the sign is plus, keep the sign of each term inside the brackets the same.
> * If the sign is minus, change the sign of each term inside the brackets.

## 4.2 Algebraic fractions
Are algebraic expressions written using fraction notation, e.g.: $a + \frac{b}{c}$. Fractions are preffered over divisin sign.

**Expanding** the algebraic fraction is useful technique when there is more terms in th numerator. such as:
$$
\frac{2a - 5b + c}{3d}
$$
The expresion can be rewritten as multiplication by the reciprocal of the denominator:
$$
\frac{1}{3d}(2a - 5b + c)
$$
Then I can multiply out the brackets:
$$
\frac{2a}{3d} - \frac{5b}{3d} + \frac{c}{3d}
$$

Once the algebraic fraction is expanded it may be possible to simplify some of the resulting terms.

# 5 Linear equations
Particularly *linear equations in one unknown*

Linear because those equations doesn't include powers, e.g.: $x^2$, thus form straigh lines on a graph.

An equation consists of two expressions:
* left-hand side (LHS)
* righ-hand side (RHS)

**Solving the equation** is the process of finding the value of the unknown. Found value is *solution* - *solution* **satisfies** the equation.

An equation can have more than one solution, e.g.: $a^2 = 4$ has two solutions - $a = 2$ and $a = -2$. Also an equation can have no solution at all, e.g.: $a^2 = -1$

## 5.2 How to solve linear equation
> **Strategy**
> * do the same thing to both sides
> * simplify one side or both sides
> * swap the sides
> * clear any fraction and multiply out any brackets. To clear a fraction, multiply both sides by a suitable number.
> * Add or subtract terms on both sides to obtain an equation of the form $\text{a number} \times \text{the unknown} = \text{a number}$
