## 1.5 Powers
### Index laws
So far I've used these:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^m \times a^n &= a^{m+n} \qquad \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \\\\
(a^m)^n &= a^{mn} \\\\
(a \times b)^n &= a^n \times b^n \qquad (\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 2 Rational numbers
Include natural numbers among others.
* Natural number is any non-negative integer: `0, 1, 2, 3, ..`

Is a number that can be written as a fraction of two integers: $\frac{integer}{integer}$.

Following numbers can be written in this form:
* Fraction as $\frac{3}{4}$
* Mixed number as $5\frac{3}{4}$ since it can be converted to top-heavy fraction: $\frac{23}{4}$
* Whole number: $7 = \frac{7}{1}$
* Decimal number with finite number of digits after decimal points: $0.42 = \frac{42}{100}$
* Some decimal numbers with infinite numbers after decimal point: $0.333\ldots = \frac{1}{3}$
* The negative of any above: $-4 = \frac{-4}{1}$

### Irrational numbers
* $\pi$
* $\sqrt{2}$

### Rational numbers as decimals
Every rational number can be converted to decimal, e.g.: $\frac{5}{8} = 5 \div 8 = 0.625$
There are two possible outcomes of the division:
* decimal number with finite digits after d.p. - **terminating decimal**
	* $0.625$ is terminating
* decimal with block of indefinitely repeating digits after d.p - **recurring decimal**
	* $\frac{2}{3} = 0.6666\ldots$ is recurring
