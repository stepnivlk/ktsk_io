Horizon was filled with mountains; thick clouds were forming over them. It was hot and damp in a very tropical way.\nI got some money out of ATM and unwrapped a massively wrapped backpack; the scrap plastic was like a football.\n\nTook a short cab ride to a camp in Calenzana, the starting town of GR20.\nThere were tens of hikers preparing or finishing their own hikes. GR20 is rather a popular trail.\nI settled in, pitched my tent, had chats with others, mostly about gear.\nLater, I brushed my teeth with a pimped-up half-toothbrush and super-concentrated outdoor paste.\nAfter that, I threw the paste into the tent to deal with it later.\nThen more chats with fellow hikers, but my eyes started to close.\nSo I sat into the tent to organize my stuff before sleep.\nSuddenly there was a fire ... on my ass? I got up just to find I sat to the most concentrated toothpaste, which I smudged everywhere. It was all over my only one pair of shorts, an expensive cuben-fiber tent floor...\nFortunately, the tent seemed ok; 30mins in shover sorted out the shots. The ass was still burning, though.\nIt was like 30*C outside, and as a true ultra lighter, I didn't even have any spare underwear, just those shorts (with liner). So I got to sleep half-naked.\nA big thunderstorm awoke the whole camp at 2 A.M. It got me up sometime before; I was listening to this rumbling over the sea with a massive soundstage slowly closing on the land.\nFlashes of lightning blink every second; it rained like crazy. There were streams of water forming below me.\nThere was solid condensation on my tent's walls given it was damp even before the storm and I was all wet from my toothpaste party. And in combination with raindrops bashing the tent on the outside, it created rain on the inside too.\nDay 1 - Calenzana -&gt; Refuge de Carozzu | 19.88 km; 2,300m up; 1,298m down\n\n\nStorm got over us around 7 A.M. Obviously, I didn't sleep much. Slowly packed the stuff; everything I had was wet. There was mud inside of my shoes.\nAt 9, after some wasted efforts to dry out the gear, I finally started walking... To the shop.\nBut after that, I found myself at the official start. Plenty of people starting, everyone was, of course, taking photos. But after this ritual, we quickly broke up, and I got some alone-time.\nIt was windy.\n\nLocally rainy.\n\nThe trail constantly went uphill, had to climb around 1600m to the first refuge.\nDuring the morning, the weather improved\n\nAnd clouds gave space to views\n\nAround lunchtime, I arrived at Refuge de l'Ortu di u Piobbu, got Coke with some muesli to the system and started to think about what next. Other hikers were already pitching their tents - way too early. I asked the hut manager what the next stage was like; he didn't understand much, had to use hands and some other hiker. I think the answer was: more or less the same as the previous one.\n\nI didn't believe that, it seemed like a short climb to saddle and a bit of a fall to the next hut from the map. So I drank 1.5l of water from the spring and got up the hill.\nThe trail indeed started with the climb to the saddle.\n\nHowever, then it continued with a long, technical ridge walk with endless ups and downs.\n\nWith some loose rocks and scrambling.\n\nSomewhere around here, I met this older guy with a much younger couple. I guessed maybe father taking kids on hike or uncle. So I dabbed them Uncle and the Kids(TM). They hiked at my pace. I got to talk with the uncle but the kids didn't speak a word in English, and they mostly ignored me. Found out they aren't related, just random people on the trail.\nIn one of those more technical sections, we met another guy who looked like he's gonna have a total breakdown every second. He was just standing there, kept telling us he's ok but refused to move. We didn't know what to do, so we left him there.\n\nThe hike down out of the ridge was very long, steep, and energy-taking - a lot of loose rocks with scrambling sections. Down in the valley, streams started to pop up; I filtered some, uncle just leaned over and drank it directly.\n\nWe arrived at the refuge rather exhausted, first thing first - beer.\nUncle and the Kids didn't have a tent nor any booking; the hut manager looked like he's gonna send them out to the wild. Then he told me there's only one spot left for my little tent - next to the trash bins.\nThen usual rituals, I cooked on the alcohol stove for the first time; really hoped I won't burn the place to the ground.\nDay 2 - Refuge de Carozzu -&gt; Ascu | 5.01km; 816m up; 668m down\n\nI got up in the middle of the night, and I was freezing. Found out my mattress was totally deflated, so I inflated it, got to sleep ... and this repeated 3 more times. So I got a puncture probably even before the first night on the trail. Plus, a second night without good sleep and counting.\n\nIn the morning I got somehow going but obviously didn't feel well; the plan was to get to the next refuge, sort out the mat, get sleep and be good &amp; happy. And that's really an over-the-hill hike.\nAs I approached the saddle, it got cold, and I had to take the long sleeve for the first (and last) time. There was thick mist on the other side of the ridge; visibility was to the nearest rock.\nSo I was just mindlessly dropping down... through the technical terrain thus I broke my knee. Some blood was pumping out; I rubbed it off with Buff every couple of minutes.\nAt 2 (P.M.) I reached Asco, broke gypsy-style camp, just to dry out everything in the sun.\nMet the Uncle and the Kids, they, of course, continued. Wished them luck; I had a mat to fix.\nThe only problem was I didn't have a repair kit, but at first, I had to find the puncture.\nTried to put it into the brook, but the water was too restless.\nAt the Therm-a-rest site, I read the best approach is to smudge the mat with soup water.\nDamn, who they think I am, some sort of Hollywood supermodel? I didn't have such an item in my inventory.\nSo I went around the camp asking for soup, got one, smudged the hell out of it but didn't find the puncture.\nWhat now? I didn't want to go shopping for a mat in the city. I bought a beer instead, then a second one.\nThen I invented this sort of a nest, pulled out padded back from the backpack, got together all the clothes (packed, not naked this time) I had, placed it bellow the mat. With an experiment, I figured ~2hrs of good sleep on nest + mat and Nhrs of bad sleep in the bare nest, hopefully limiting reinflate operations during the night. That could work.\nI still felt quite out of my skin. Also, I had really high resting HR, around 100BPM, essentially the same as when walking.\nLater I simply hung out and had some chats with fellow hikers.\nCooked some meal, left packed stove in the vestibule of the tent, and fell asleep.\nDay 3 | 1.9. 2020 | Ascu -&gt; Castel de Vergio | 23.51 km; 2,021m up; 1,298m\n\nIt was around 3:30 when the cold awoke me, it means the nest was working, but the cold was still bitter as well as fragmented sleep. HR was at 100BPM. I inflated the mat and fell asleep.\nI got awake again at 4:30, this time not because of the mat. There was an attack on my tent. I heard this quick, sneaky sound followed by a sad jingle of my stove moving away. So probably a fox took it away, but why? I cleaned it precisely after lunch. Suddenly I remembered I kept a pack of outdoor coffee stuffed in it, and the fox was probably up to some caffeine. \nThat was like the last bit for me; I was lying there, in the nest, relatively exhausted, thinking if I should pack my stuff and go sit on some beach instead of this chain of failures. Well, anyway, I got up to chase the thief.\nAfter a bit of uphill walk in the bushes, I found the stove! The stuff sack was on pieces; there was just a single bite in the coffee. It wasn't good enough or what?\nSo I cleaned up the mess, got back to nest but wasn't able to fall asleep; this was my very bottom of the whole trail. I wanted to give up.\nSomewhat mechanically, I packed the gear and hit the trail as usual. I thought, screw it, what other disaster can possibly happen.\nThis stage was no joke though, there was a climb to the ridges of Mt. Cinto, the highest peak of Corsica, ahead of me. Basically 1188m of ascent in one go. HR was, of course, at 100BPM.\n\nSo I put some music in my ears and got going. Sun was shining behind the ridge. The air was crisp and crystal clear - the promise of a nice day in the mountains.\n\nThe landscape was pleasantly mountainous, sparkled with Mediterrane vegetation here and there.\n\nAt this point, I started to feel like I'm in the best place I could possibly be and started to fully enjoy the hike. Very opposite of how I felt just a couple of hours before.\n\nGot in a serious flow, flew up the hill like nothing (well, I felt like that).\n\nOn the top, I hung out a bit and continued with quite a technical scramble on the ridge.\n\nThen free fall through a massive slope of loose scree.\n\nWhen I was getting ahead of one colleague, I told him I don't feel comfortable on those loose rocks after my recent arm-braking incident.\nLater we met this group of guys racing downhill against each other, and again I was like screw it and joined them. We mostly ran, and I totally forgot about what I was saying a couple of moments ago.\n\nDown in the valley, we had to scramble all the time.\n\nI only had tiny moments to decide which limb goes where. Really enjoyed this living-in-the-present sensation brought by it.\n\nAnd I finished first. Had to cool down my legs in a lagoon.\n\nI ate lunch of champions on the first refuge in the valley.\n\nOn the second, I bought 400g of cheese, on both combined I drank 3l of water, the sun was starting to show its power.\nThe plan was to get over one more ridge and combine two official stages.\nFirst, it was an easy flat walk, but then the climb began. The sun was burning everything around. Other hikers were climbing up too. I often caught up with some of them; usually, they were pretty polite and wanted to let me go ahead. But that's like an obligation to move faster and lose them a bit together with remaining energy.\nAt least clouds were pushing from the other side of the ridge.\n\nThe way slowly fell down into this amazing remote valley.\n\nDown.\n\nTo the Forrest.\n\nWhere I broke a pole in between some roots like nothing. Damn these ultralight tinfoils...\nI needed at least one pole to pitch the tent, and by this experiment, I figured it's not very hard to break one. So I decided to carry a broken one for spare parts, like an antenna on the backpack.\nHowever, it made me realized that I was exhausted, didn't sleep properly for god knows how long, and just hiked over the most demanding section of GR20. I sat down and ate the whole cheese I bought before, simply like that, without anything else. Suddenly the walk went much better.\nI arrived very much wretched to the refuge but with a feeling of a day fully lived through. Falling asleep was a matter of seconds; the nest wasn't a problem this time.\nDay 4 | 2.9. 2020 | Castel de Vergio -&gt; Petra Piana | 26.32 km; 1,577m up; 1,140m\n\nI had to reinflate only two times over the night. But still, I desperately needed to improve my quality of sleep. And for that, I hatched a plan - on the next refuge, I will try to panhandle some of their spare mats. For this purpose, my amazing girlfriend sent me a manual full of french phrases including \"I broke my matters, can I borrow one of yours?\".\nToday it all started with a grassy, mushy landscape; it was so restorative against beaten feet.\n\nIt looked like from Lord of the Rings dashed with a bit of Death Stranding.\n\nSo I put on its soundtrack and felt like Sam Porter Bridges. My load of 7kg felt a bit pathetic, though.\n\nI had lunch at the refuge Manganu - coke and a piece of chocolate. Checked the weather with hut manager, all good, so I had no excuse to continue.\n\n\nThis stage was amazing but tough. You basically scramble around glacial lakes 500m above them, all very airy. I got together with two guys here, french; hence we talked with hands. But we were a good team, like some elite hiking unit flying over the trail. And the trail was beautifully demanding, climbing sections everywhere, moraine fields...\n\nBroke the other knee here, cured it with buff again.\nWhen we arrived at the refuge, I interestingly felt quite good. Went to the hut manager to try to borrow the mat, and it went the followingly:\n\n\"Hi, sorry I don't speak French, is English ok?\"\n\"Meh.\"\n\"Can I pitch my tent in here?\"\n\"You want to rent a tent?\"\n\"No, I have my tent,\" I point to myself.\n\"Ok, 8E.\"\n\"And can I ask you, I punctured my mattress, would it be possible to borrow one of yours?\"\n\"You broke your tent?\"\n\"No, my mattress was broken\" I showed cross with my hands.\n\"Eh?\"\n\"My tapi de mus broken,\" I showed the manual my girlfriend sent me.\n\"Oh, your tapidemu, no problem, see that guy? Ask him.\"\n\nSo I had to repeat the same conversation, but in the end, I got a mat! Hooray.\nI also picked a convenient spot to pitch a tent near this big rock I called workbench; in a minute, my whole backpack exploded there.\n\nSince we had a new month, I washed my self and some of the clothes.\nAnd again I fell asleep totally exhausted &amp; happy.\nDay 5 | 3.9. 2020 | Petra Piana -&gt; Vizzavona | 18.15 km; 1,058m up; 1,979m\n\nIt got freezing in the night, but I regenerated much better on a real mat than a nest. I was ready to go at 8:30. Actually, that's my superpower here; I'm usually glad when I start cooking sometime after 7.\nToday, it all started with nice ridge walk; sometimes, there was a bit of scramble but nothing serious as yesterday. It reminded me of Carpathians.\n\nHad lunch above the refuge Onda - snickers followed by another big climb in the prime sun. Which made me soo slow and dizzy. I got to the saddle like a winner just to realize I had to fall 1000m down to the town of Vizzavona.\n\n\nOriginally I didn't even want to stop there and go to the next stage right away. However, there was gossip going on on the trail that they cook pizza down there.\nSo in the town, I indeed got pizza (and some beers, of course), had some chats with fellow hikers. And started planning how much time it'll get to finish the whole trail. I estimated 4 more days.\nVizzavona divides the northern part of GR20 I just did and the southern part. Which is supposed to be less technical and more walkable.\n\nDay 6 | 4.9. 2020 | Vizzavona -&gt; Refuge de Prati | 34.84km; 2,064m up; 1,172m down\n\nToday was indeed a fast day. It all started with 1000m of a very gentle climb on dirt roads through forests. Around lunchtime, I arrived at a refuge; had coke &amp; omelet. There were some Czech guys, so I had an opportunity to chat in my native language. They had huge ~20kg backpacks; I wished them my condolences and got going.\n\nThen I met the uncle from the uncle and the kids' team, but he lost the kids. We exchanged trail stories and split after a while but agreed on the common refuge (and beer) of the day.\n\n\nNext, I had an opportunity to enjoy a flat walk before the final climb to a ridge.\nSuddenly, the mountains were different; everything was more open, grassy with big white rocks here and there. Lord of the Rings: chapter 2?\n\nWhen I arrived to refuge, it got even better. It was on top of a high plateau, with those new, fresh and romantic mountains all around, fluffy clouds flitted around peaks. Golden hour was about to start. And there was a panoramic view of a see 2km below us. It took my breath away.\n\nHad a nice chat with the hut manager; borrowing a mat was an easy job.\n\nI cooked the dinner almost as a native french man:\n\nThen some beers and chats followed by sleep in a million stars hotel.\nDay 7 | 5.9. 2020 | Refuge de Prati -&gt; Refuge d'Asinau | 28.95km; 1,935m up; 2,140m down\n\nI had such a late start that even the staff had already cleaned everything and were merely chilling around.\nThe trail was playing with me this time, it was running just below the ridge, but I had to constantly switch sides of it. Sometimes there was a nice solid trail, sometimes serious scrambling.\n\nSun wasn't that hard on me (yet). I was genuinely enjoying it.\nAround noon I met the uncle, and together we've slowly moved to the next refuge while dreaming what to order for lunch. When we got there, we found out that, actually, the hut manager had lunch. Thus he was closed for business. So we sat down, ate some of our provisions, and patiently waited.\n\nWith some more hikers, we started to plan what next. There were two variants ahead of us. One was direct, but 20km through a long valley followed by a big hill to the next refuge, marked as a day-long demanding hike in the guide.\nThe second one went rather around over a couple of intermediate refuges and was supposed to be easy. Others wanted to take it easy; I sought risks, pain and destruction, so I pushed them for the first one. Well, in the end, I went alone.\n\nBefore dropping to the valley, there was an extra ridge ahead of me, seemed short on the map. In reality, it was a technical and tedious scramble under the scorching sun.\nThe sun started to be a real problem down in the south. There was no wind; the rocks were all white; hence it acted as a reflector. Mirages everywhere around.\nBut in the end, the ridge spilled me out\n\nSuddenly, I found myself walking through very different terrain again. This time it was a steppe; Now I was a cowboy from some western. Completely alone in this wild, dusty landscape with exotic plants all around. There have been so many dramatic scenery changes on this hike, I wasn't able to believe I went through yet another one.\n\nAfter the steppe, I had to climb that big hill.\n\nIt was that kind with 5 false peaks before the true one.\n\nAnd whenever you triumphantly reach one of those, the next one pops behind.\n\nI enjoyed the silence on the top, then had to fall steeply down to the next refuge on the other side of the hill.\n\nConstant scrambling on tired legs in the approaching dark.\nI started to dislike the refuge almost instantly; it seemed like the fact that I was close to civilization had something to do with it.\nThere were fresh, clean people that tended to not say hi and overall be smug. At least in my head.\nOn top of that, there was basically no place to pitch a tent. After some struggle and checking with various managers, I had to take a bed in a dormitory with many other people.\nDidn't imagine my last night on the trail to be like that. Especially after a heavenly experience the day before.\nIt was hot, sweaty during the night, sometimes someone farted, the guy next to me slept on plastic covers, so I could hear every move...\nDay 8 | 6.9. 2020 | Refuge d'Asinau -&gt; Conca | 30.48km; 1,133m up; 2,378m down\n\nLast day on the trail, mostly downhil so I aimed to oversleep as much as possible. Ate breakfast as the very last non-staff person in the camp.\nAt the water source, there was donkey drinking; I needed to drink too, so I came by, he moved a bit, and we simply drank together there, like some hippies.\nThen I started hiking; it was quite an ordinary walk in an ordinary forest this time. Started to meet day hikers; they were very refined and smelled like washing powder.\nAround lunchtime, I arrived at the Village de Bavella, a popular spot for hikers; there's a nice road, restaurants, and a big parking spot.\nTo me it was like being in the middle of some circus there.\nFor lunch, I bought crepes with cheese and french fries and coke, of course.\nNext, there was quite a climb on the menu, although I was in general slowly going down to 200 meters above the sea.\nThat meant the plants were getting more and more exotic and were absolutely stunning now - sort of greeny, spiky, thick stuff everywhere.\nOn the negative side, the sun was burning me alive.\n\nAt this point, I started to feel the tension in my stomach; it felt like it's getting out of order. Started to think that the lunch was a big mistake.\nThere was literally no processing going on when I tried to drink water. It was just splashing as if there was some stopper in my belly.\nThe problem was, there was this massive fusion reactor above me reaching its peak performance. This time yesterday, I already had 6l of water in me.\nI started to be sluggish, like I was about to pass out. Every 30mins, I had to sit down and just stare at nowhere. I was convincing myself the body only needed some time to process the food.\nAnd always, after some serious time of staring, I started to feel a bit better, got up, walked a couple of meters, and got back to this about-to-throw-up-then-pass-out state.\nSections without any shade were the worst, and there were many of those. It started to feel dangerous; I just kept telling myself - dude, you can't stop here.\nWhen I reached some shade, I always felt down right away, sometimes to sleep, just like that on rocks. Sometimes I threw up some fluids.\n\nAfter what felt like infinity, I arrived at some waterfall with lagoons and slowly got whole myself in. That helped a lot, stomach stopped cramping, and I finally managed to drink.\nThen it was only over the hill down to Conca - my destination. And as it was getting later, even the sun started to burn less.\nSo I simply walked and walked, now quite sure I was able to make it without dying. And indeed, after a couple of hours, I found myself at the end of GR20.\n\nIt was funny how natives ignored me; they probably have their scoop of experiences with finishing hikers.\nSo I, a battered, dirty, smelly person, probably with some vomit on himself, sat down to a bar, ordered a coke, and watched football with them.\nThen celebratory call with my girlfriend, camp, shower, stars, chats, sleep.\n\nAnd that was basically it.\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/outdoors/hiking-gr20/","title":"How I hiked GR20"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/":{"body":"","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/","title":"Programming"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/building-git-notes/":{"body":"\nThese are my notes taken while reading the Building Git book (https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/).\n\n2.

In this commit the headers are:\n\ncommit 184 - its own header\ntree - reference to a single tree representing the state of files at that point in the history.\nauthor - simple metadata\ncommitter - simple metadata\n\nComputing object IDs\nObjects are named by taking SHA-1 hash of their content prepended with a header before compressing them.\nSHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function, it takes input of arbitrary sized string and outputs a fixed-size 20B number.\nIt's designed in such a way that it should be effectivelly impossible to find two inputs that has to the same output.\nThere are $2^{160}$ of possible object IDs so its computationally infeasible to find a collision.\nThis is property is a key to the distributed nature of Git - no two distinct objects in any repository will be given the same ID.\nAlso comparition becomes simple - if two objects have same ID they are same.\nProblems with SHA-1\nA hash is considered broken when there is an attack requiring less than $2^\\frac{n}{2}$ ($n$ being the size of the output in bits) inputs to find a collision. For SHA-1 tht means an attack requiring fewer than $2^{80}$ steps.\nIn 2005 an attack requiring $5.9 \\times 10^{20}$ steps was reported (https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html).\nIn 2017 Google announced an attach requiring $9.2 \\times 10^{18}$ (https://shattered.io/)\nThe migration to SHA-256 is possible however Git doesn't rely on SHA-1 as proof of trust, it's an integrity check against accidental damage. From this perspective SHA-1 is good enough.\nMoreover for an attacker to replace an object it's not enough to find a collision, he needs to find collision with concrete blob.\n3. The first commit\ninit\nThe very first step is git init the bare essentials for it are objects and refs folder and HEAD file. With those Git will consider the directory valid.\ncommit\n\nWorkspace is responsible for the files in the working tree - all the files that are edited directly, rather than those stored in .git.\n\n4. Making history\nWhen adding second commit via Git I get:\n~&gt; git commit -m 'Second commit.'\n[master 2d719c9] Second commit.\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\nThere's no root-commit now since it follows on from the previous commit.\nThe ID of the second commit is stored in master ref:\n~&gt; cat .git/refs/heads/master\n2d719c90a3c181782e6e07e2fd027f90ab5de0b5\n\nThere's a parent field in the object representing second commit:\n~&gt; git cat-file -p 2d719c90a3c181782e6e07e2fd027f90ab5de0b5\ntree 040c6f3e807f0d433870584bc91e06b6046b955d\nparent 65b1d9312836b1e84233b209d8d066038aead925\nauthor Tomas Koutsky &lt;tomas@stepnivlk.net&gt; 1617213880 +0200\ncommitter Tomas Koutsky &lt;tomas@stepnivlk.net&gt; 1617213880 +0200\n\nSecond commit.\n\nThe ID behind parent points to the first commit:\n~&gt; git cat-file -p 65b1d9312836b1e84233b209d8d066038aead925\ntree 88e38705fdbd3608cddbe904b67c731f3234c45b\nauthor Tomas Koutsky &lt;tomas@stepnivlk.net&gt; 1616955235 +0200\ncommitter Tomas Koutsky &lt;tomas@stepnivlk.net&gt; 1616955235 +0200\n\nFirst commit.\n\nSo each commit made after the root one has parent field pointing to previous commit. This allows for understanding of how commits are causually connected.\nEach tree contains the snapshot of all the files.\nFirst tree:\n~&gt; git cat-file -p 88e38705fdbd3608cddbe904b67c731f3234c45b\n100644 blob ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a\thello.txt\n100644 blob cc628ccd10742baea8241c5924df992b5c019f71\tworld.txt\n\nSecond tree:\n~&gt; git cat-file -p 040c6f3e807f0d433870584bc91e06b6046b955d\n100644 blob e019be006cf33489e2d0177a3837a2384eddebc5\thello.txt\n100644 blob cc628ccd10742baea8241c5924df992b5c019f71\tworld.txt\n\nworld.txt is same object with same ID as its content didn't change and IDs of objects are derived from their contents.\nThus Git only creates new blobs when files have their content changed. Files with same content will point to same blob even when those files appear in many trees across many commits.\n4.2 Implementing the parent chain\n.git/HEAD needs to be updated when storing commits however it has to be done in safe, atomic way as there may be multiple readers. Multiple writers are considered as an error. This can be tackled using a lockfile.\n5 Growing trees\n5.1 Executable files\nWhen commiting executable file:\n~&gt; touch cruel.txt\n~&gt; chmod +x cruel.txt \n~&gt; git add cruel.txt \n~&gt; git commit -m 'Third commit.'\n[master 91c525a] Third commit.\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n create mode 100755 cruel.txt\n\nThe mode is 100755 instead of 100644 and it's stored in the tree:\n~&gt; git cat-file -p HEAD^{tree}\n100755 blob e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391\tcruel.txt\n100644 blob e019be006cf33489e2d0177a3837a2384eddebc5\thello.txt\n100644 blob cc628ccd10742baea8241c5924df992b5c019f71\tworld.txt\n\nThe mode is in base 8, it makes it easier to read in the compact format. First 4 bits are file type related, others are permissions (special, user, group other).\nE.g. in 100644:\n\n10 - regular file\n0 - no special permissions\n6 - owner can rw\n4 - members of the group can read\n4 - others can read\nIn 100755:\n7 - owner can rw + execute\n5 - members of the group can r + execute\n5 - others can r + execute\n\nGit only uses very restricted permissions - whether owner can execute, rest is thrown out:\n~&gt; touch out.txt\n~&gt; chmod 655 out.txt \n~&gt; git add out.txt \n~&gt; git commit -m 'Forth commit.'\n[master 27df932] Forth commit.\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 out.txt\n\nThus Git only has two modes - 100644 and 100755.\n5.2 Nested trees\nTrees can be arbitrarily nested:\n~&gt; mkdir -p a/b\n~&gt; touch a/b/c.txt\n~&gt; git add .\n~&gt; git commit -m 'First commit.'\n~&gt; git cat-file -p HEAD^{tree}\n\n040000 tree c4a644afb090a8303bdb28306a2f803017551f25\ta\n\nHexdump:\n~&gt; cat .git/objects/c4/a644afb090a8303bdb28306a2f803017551f25 | ./inflate.sh | hexdump -C\n00000000  74 72 65 65 20 32 38 00  34 30 30 30 30 20 62 00  |tree 28.40000 b.|\n00000010  17 21 a7 a9 1e 87 f5 41  3c 84 2a 9c 5c e7 3f 67  |.!.....A&lt;.*.\\.?g|\n00000020  44 59 e9 2b 0a                                    |DY.+.|\n00000025\n\nThe mode is 40000. In Unix, directories have file type bits set to 4 and permissions to 755. Git ingones all the permissions and just stores 40000 to indicate it's a directory.\na of course points to b - another tree.\nThe content of a tree is just a list of IDs and names of this contents and SHA-1 hashes the content. Thus when two trees have same IDs it means all their contents are same, recursively.\nThis method of storing a tree of information where each tree is labelled with the has of its children is called a Merkle tree.\nEntries in trees have to be sorted in order to compare those effectively. Git sorts the file list for the entire project before building trees, thus it sorts following entries:\nfoo # dir with bar.txt entry\nfoo.txt\n\nas:\nfoo.txt\nfoo\n\nIt sees foo as foo/bar.txt.\nIn Git, the add command reads the working tree, stores blobs in the database and adds them to the index. commit reads the index to create trees. The index is stored as flat list of paths.\n6. The index\nCurrent commit implementation reads and hashes every file in the project in order to store blobs, that's ineffective. Usually, in larger projects, only small subset of files is changed in commit. Moreover, the current implementation is cumbersome to use. The user should control what goes in a commit.\nThe add command and the index solve the problem by providing a cache of all the blobs representing the current state of the project. It contains the object IDs of the blobs corresponding the the current files plus a lot of information from the filesystem (size of files, timestamps).\n6.2 Inspecting .git/index\nLet's consider following scenario:\n~&gt; touch file.txt\n~&gt; git status\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\tfile.txt\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n~&gt; git add file.txt\n~&gt; git status\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n\tnew file:   file.txt\n\n~&gt; echo \"new content\" &gt; file.txt\n~&gt; git status\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n\tnew file:   file.txt\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\tmodified:   file.txt\n\nWhat does it mean for change to be staged?\n~&gt; hexdump -C .git/index\n00000000  44 49 52 43 00 00 00 02  00 00 00 01 60 66 e1 3d  |DIRC........`f.=|\n00000010  15 7d 40 fe 60 66 e1 3d  15 7d 40 fe 00 00 00 1a  |.}@.`f.=.}@.....|\n00000020  00 1f 40 63 00 00 81 a4  00 00 03 e8 00 00 03 e8  |..@c............|\n00000030  00 00 00 00 e6 9d e2 9b  b2 d1 d6 43 4b 8b 29 ae  |...........CK.).|\n00000040  77 5a d8 c2 e4 8c 53 91  00 08 66 69 6c 65 2e 74  |wZ....S...file.t|\n00000050  78 74 00 00 4a a4 ed 90  d2 ca 32 07 52 b6 39 d3  |xt..J.....2.R.9.|\n00000060  e4 31 4b bb fc 72 8e 2d                           |.1K..r.-|\n00000068\n\nBy checking https://git-scm.com/docs/index-format I ca see that the index starts with:\n\nA 12-byte header consisting of\n\n4-byte signature:\n\nThe signature is { 'D', 'I', 'R', 'C' } (stands for \"dircache\")\n\n\n4-byte version number:\n\nThe current supported versions are 2, 3 and 4.\n\n\n32-bit number of index entries.\n\n\n\nThus the header part of the dump is:\n44 49 52 43 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 01\n-----------|-----------|-----------\n   DIRC    |    v2     |  1 entry\n\nThe header is followed by entries themselves, each entry starts with ten 4-byte stat numbers:\nctime seconds, the last time a file's metadata changed\nctime nanosecond fractions\nmtime seconds, the last time a file's data changed\nmtime nanosecond fractions\ndev\nino\nmode\nuid\ngid\nfile size\n\n\nctame - time when content or metadata was changed\nmtame - time when content was changed\ndev - ID of hardware storage\nnon - number of inode\n\nTo list all the files in the index:\n~&gt; git ls-files --stage\n100644 e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 0\tfile.txt\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/building-git-notes/","title":"Building Git Notes"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/decoding-youtube-filters/":{"body":"Introduction\nRecently, I was searching for some videos on Youtube and noticed the search filters aren't passed to the server as a series of key-value strings on the URL as one might expect, e.g.:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cassini?type=video&amp;features=4k\n\nInstead, all the active filters are somehow combined and encoded to the sp query parameter. So the valid version of the previously mentioned URL is:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cassini&amp;sp=EgQQAXAB\n\nThere is some function on Youtube that encodes Type: Video and Features: 4K filters to EgQQAXAB. I can only guess what's the reasoning behind such an opaque approach. More importantly, it made me curious how the encoding works concretely. Hence as a little mental excercise, I set out to decode it.\nReading the data\nEgQQAXAB looks like base64 encoded data, so let's fire up ptpython and try to decode it:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import base64\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; filter = 'EgQQAXAB'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes = base64.b64decode(filter)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes\nb'\\x12\\x04\\x10\\x01p\\x01'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes.decode('utf-8')\n'\\x12\\x04\\x10\\x01p\\x01'\n\nWe're dealing with some binary that is not a utf-8 string. Hence converting the bytes to a more explorable form is the logical next step:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [format(byte, '08b') for byte in bytes]\n['00010010', '00000100', '00010000', '00000001', '01110000', '00000001']\n\nOk, we're in. What now?\nThere's not much else to do besides looking at various combinations of filters and trying to spot pattern(s).\nWhat about EgQQASAB that encodes Type: Video and Features: HD filters?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; filter = 'EgQQASAB'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes = base64.b64decode(filter)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [format(byte, '08b') for byte in bytes]\n['00010010', '00000100', '00010000', '00000001', '00100000', '00000001']\n\nWhat can we observe?\nThe first 4 bytes are the same. Fifth is different, so it probably encodes different feature filters:\n\n01110000 is 4K feature filter\n00100000 is HD feature filter\n\nBefore validating the assumptions, it would be useful to reduce repetitive code, print bytes in more readable form, and be able to compare different sps.\nWe can use the following little piece of code to achieve that:\nimport base64\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n\ndef decode_sp(sp):\n    sp = base64.b64decode(sp)\n\n    return [format(byte, '08b') for byte in sp]\n\n\ndef build_header(labeled_sps):\n     bytes_len = [len(bytes) for _, bytes in labeled_sps]\n     header_bytes_part = [i for i in range(max(bytes_len))]\n\n     return [\"label\"] + header_bytes_part\n\n\ndef print_sps(sps):\n    sps = [(label, decode_sp(sp)) for label, sp in sps]\n    header = build_header(sps)\n    sps = [[label, *sp] for label, sp in sps]\n    table = tabulate(sps, headers=header)\n\n    print(table)\n\nThat allows us to stay organized and compare various sps:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sps = [('type=video, features=4k', 'EgQQAXAB'), ('type=video, features=hd', 'EgQQASAB')]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print_sps(sps)\nlabel                           0         1         2         3         4         5\n-----------------------  --------  --------  --------  --------  --------  --------\ntype=video, features=4k  00010010  00000100  00010000  00000001  01110000  00000001\ntype=video, features=hd  00010010  00000100  00010000  00000001  00100000  00000001\n\n\nMoving forward I'm going to format the output to markdown table to further improve readability:\nLabelSPB0B1B2B3B4B5\ntype=video, features=4kEgQQAXAB000100100000010000010000000000010111000000000001\ntype=video, features=hdEgQQASAB000100100000010000010000000000010010000000000001\n\nMaking sense of the data\nWhat about multiple active features filters?\nLabelSPB0B1B2B3B4B5B6B7\ntype=video, features=4kEgQQAXAB000100100000010000010000000000010111000000000001\ntype=video, features=hdEgQQASAB000100100000010000010000000000010010000000000001\ntype=video, features=hd+4kEgYQASABcAE=0001001000000110000100000000000100100000000000010111000000000001\n\nNow we're talking.\nB0 is a constant (at least in current sample space) and probably a header.\nB1 changed from 00000100 to 00000110 after the introduction of an additional feature.\nIs it a counter of active filters? The first two sps contain 2 filters - 10 in binary, third has three filters - 11 in binary.\nWhy counting doesn't start at the rightmost bit though?\nB2 is the same for all the filters, it most likely identifies type: video filter that has been active for all the configurations.\nMoreover, the following may hold:\n\n00100000 identifies feature: HD filter\n01110000 identifies feature: 4K filter\n00000001 looks like some spacer in between of filters\n\nWe can easily validate the counter assumption by applying an additional filter:\nLabelSPB0B1...\ntype=video, features=hd+4k+liveEgQQAXAB0001001000001000...\n\nIt's official, B1 contains a counter that is shifted by one to the left for an unknown reason. We can consider it being part of a header and draft a specification:\nSpecification v1\nThe sp is base64 encoded binary.\nFirst 2 bytes are header.\nThe header is followed by one or more filters.\nHeader\nB0 constantB1 counter\n00010010B7-B1: counter; B0: 0\n\nExample\nHeader - ConstHeader - Count: 2Type: VideoSpacer?Features: 4KSpacer?\n000100100000010000010000000000010111000000000001\n\nWe have some understanding of the header and shape of some filters. Now we can apply different filters to see whether our assumptions hold for those.\nAdditional filter types\nLet's observe EgQIAhAB sp encoding Type: Video and Upload date: Today filters:\nB0 Header - ConstB1 Header - Count: 2B2 ?B3 ?B4 Type: VideoB5 Spacer?\n000100100000010000001000000000100001000000000001\n\nB0 and B1 still hold our assumption. However Type: Video filter together with spacer moved from B2 and B3 to B4 and B5 respectively. Meaning B2 should identify Upload date: Today but B3 is not usual assumed spacer byte.\nMaybe looking at yet another filter type may be of help.

What if there's nothing like a spacer and each piece of information in the sp is composed of two bytes wide words? And what if the order of filter words doesn't really matter?\nWe can try to decode a combination of all known filters to see whether all the assumptions fit well.\nThe EgoIAhABGAMgAXAB sp contains following filters\n\nType: Video\nFeatures: 4K + HD\nDuration: 4 - 20 minutes\nUpload date: Today\n\nFrom previous observations and assumptions made we know that the header should contain 5 in binary - 101 and that the filters should decode as:\nType: VideoFeatures: 4KFeatures: HDUpload date: TodayDuration: 4 - 20 mins\n00010000,0000000101110000,0000000100100000,0000000100001000,0000001000011000,00000011\n\nLet's try to find a match in whole decoded sp:\nHeader Count: 5Upload date: TodayType: VideoDuration: 4-20minsFeatures: HDFeatures: 4K\n00010010,0000101000001000,0000001000010000,0000000100011000,0000001100100000,0000000101110000,00000001\n\nAll good, it seems like our assumptions are valid. Thus we can update our specification.\nSpecification v2\nThe sp is base64 encoded binary. The binary consists of 2 bytes wide words.\nThe first word is a header which is followed by one or more filter words.\nHeader\nThe first byte is constant, second contains a counter of filter words.\nB0 constantB1\n00010010b7 - b1: counter; b0: 0\n\nFilters catalog\nType\nLabelBinary value\nVideo00010000,00000001\n\nFeatures\nLabelBinary value\n4K01110000,00000001\nHD00100000,00000001\n\nUpload date\nLabelBinary value\nToday00001000,00000010\n\nDuration\nLabelBinary value\n4 - 20 minutes00011000,00000011\n\nExample\nHeader ConstHeader Count: 2Type: VideoFeatures: 4K\n000100100000010000010000,0000000101110000,00000001\n\nBreaking the rules\nWe can try to tinker with some additional combinations to see whether we fully cracked the encoding logic.\nWhat about usual Type: Video combined with Features: HDR given by EgUQAcgBAQ== sp?\nB0 Header ConstB1 What?B2-3 Type: VideoB4 ?B5 ?B6 ?\n000100100000010100010000,00000001110010000000000100000001\n\nNow, this is different.\nBit 0 on the counter got finally activated. B2 and B3 clearly identify Type: Video filter that is followed by 3 bytes.\nThe only possible conclusion is that bit 0 of the counter marks the presence of special 3-bytes long filter.\nThat seems to be included in the counter and I assume it will always be the last filter in the sp. Otherwise parsing would be a nightmare.\nWe can again apply all the known filters together with Features: HDR to validate the assumptions.

All were accepted and correctly parsed.\nOf course, there are some additional nuances to the filters. For example when Type: Movie filter is active, only certain additional filters can be appended.\nAlso, I didn't cover sorting.\nThe core workings behind the sp should be covered though. \nOne might write an encoder/decoder of the spbased on this breakdown.\nAs I don't have use of such program I'll leave it on fellow readers that would benefit from it.\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/decoding-youtube-filters/","title":"Decoding Youtube filters"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/webpack-cache-bust/":{"body":"Most JavaScript developers are familiar with this problem. You have a bug in your system; you fix it, ship it… and your error monitoring still spams you with the problem, which was apparently fixed. How come? Your responses have cache headers set, and the client's browser caches static assets. But web development is very dynamic nowadays; we deploy multiple times per day. So how can we continue with aggressive deployment and still cache static assets?\nYou can use query string to version your assets:\n&lt;script src=”/bundles/app.bundle.js?v=23” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nUnfortunately, some CDNs and proxies don't cache assets with query strings at all. Moreover, versioning here is a very manual process, thus doomed to be forgotten.\nWhat else? Of course, you can include your version in a path or in a file name:\n&lt;script src=”/bundles/v23/app.bundle.js” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n...\n&lt;script src=”/bundles/app.bundle.v23.js” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nBetter and valid for CDNs and proxies. But still too manual, we need something automatic and more sophisticated. So whenever someone builds an asset, the version will be automatically busted. Only then will the feature be handy (even managers will be able to invalidate a cache).\nLet's try to automate it! Since the title of this post starts with Hey Webpack, we will focus on Webpack based solutions. We will build a very tiny example React application because React is cool. But it doesn't matter; you can use this solution with whatever library (or framework) you want as long as it will be built using Webpack.\nWe start with initializing the project and adding some libraries:\n➜ mkdir cache-busters &amp;&amp; cd cache-busters\n\n➜ cache-busters yarn init\n\n➜ cache-busters yarn add react react-dom\n\n➜ cache-busters yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react css-loader\n\nNow let's create some basic directory structure:\n➜ cache-busters mkdir config\n\n➜ cache-busters mkdir config/webpack\n\n➜ cache-busters mkdir src\n\n➜ cache-busters touch src/index.jsx\n\n➜ cache-busters mkdir src\n\n➜ cache-busters mkdir src/components\n\n➜ cache-busters mkdir src/assets\n\n➜ cache-busters touch src/assets/style.css\n\n➜ cache-busters mkdir public\n\n➜ cache-busters touch public/index.html\n\n➜ cache-busters mkdir public/bundles\n\n➜ cache-busters touch .babelrc\n\nAdd Babel preset to .babelrc:\n{\n\n  \"presets\": [\"react\"]\n\n}\n\nOk, time to get our hands dirty; now we start to configure the Webpack. We want to have one basic configuration file with just an entry point definition and some rules. Then we'll add two separate configurations for development and production environments, which would enhance basic configuration. Using this setup, we can define plugins for each environment separately:\n➜ cache-busters touch config/webpack/config.js\n\n➜ cache-busters touch config/webpack/config.production.js\n\n➜ cache-busters touch config/webpack/config.development.js\n// config/webpack/config.js\n\nconst path = require('path')\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: {\n    app: [\n      path.resolve(__dirname, '../../src/index.jsx'),\n    ],\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /.jsx?$/,\n        use: ['babel-loader'],\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\n          use: 'css-loader',\n        }),\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    modules: [\n      'node_modules',\n      path.resolve(__dirname, '../../src'),\n    ],\n    extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],\n    alias: {\n      react: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../node_modules', 'react'),\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n\nWebpack now knows our entry point and is instructed to use babel-loader for js/jsx and css-loader for CSS files.\nNow it's time to add basic development configuration, so we'll be able to actually build our application and run webpack-dev-server:\n// config/webpack.development.js\n\nconst webpack = require('webpack')\nconst config = require('./config')\n\nconfig.output = {\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../public/bundles'),\n  filename: '[name].bundle.js',\n  chunkFilename: \"[name].js\",\n  publicPath: '/bundles/',\n}\n\nmodule.exports = config\n\nHere we told Webpack where it should store output files and defined file names.\nWe're almost ready for our first development build! We need to just add index.html file, React component, and some basic styling:\n// public/index.html\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Cache Busters&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/bundles/app.bundle.css\"&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/bundles/app.bundle.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n// src/index.jsx\n\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\n\nconst CacheBusters = () =&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;Stays Puft, Even When Toasted&lt;/div&gt;\n\nrender(\n  &lt;CacheBusters /&gt;,\n  document.getElementById('app'),\n)\n// src/assets/style.css\n\nbody {\n  background-color: purple;\n}\n\nAnd finally, we can add the start script to package.json:\n{\n\n  // …\n\n  \"scripts\": {\n\n    \"start\": \"webpack-dev-server — config config/webpack/config.development.js — content-base public/\",\n\n  },\n\n  // …\n\n}\n\nNow lets try to build &amp; start webpack-dev-server:\n➜ cache-busters yarn start\n\nyarn start v0.22.0\n\n$ webpack-dev-server — config config/webpack/config.development.js — content-base public/ — history-api-fallback\n\n...\n\nVersion: webpack 3.0.0\n\nTime: 1681ms\n\nAsset Size Chunks Chunk Names\n\napp.bundle.js 1.06 MB 0 [emitted] [big] app\n\napp.bundle.css  40 bytes       0  [emitted] app\n\n...\n\n+ 252 hidden modules\n\nwebpack: Compiled successfully.\n\nNice 1MB hello world, our setup works, we can check webpack-dev-server running at a given URL: http://localhost:8080/.\nTime to move on to production configuration!\nLet's repeat our goal once more. Upon each production build, we want our static assets to contain a hash (which would be different than the previous one only if the code was changed) and our index.html to be dynamically generated with correct assets names (containing a hash), e.g.:\n&lt;script src=”/bundles/app.bundle.9f61f58dd1cc3bb82182.js” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nAdding a hash is easy, Webpack gives us two options:\n[hash] — calculated for build and [chunkhash] — calculated for entry file. For our use case, chunkhash will be a better option. Since we can selectively bust only, e.g., app.bundle.js and no app.bundle.css if we changed code just in the javascript part of our application:\n// config/webpack/config.production.js\n\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')\nconst path = require('path')\nconst config = require('./config')\n\nconfig.plugins.push(\n  new ExtractTextPlugin({\n    filename: 'app.bundle.[chunkhash].css',\n    allChunks: true\n  })\n)\n\nconfig.output = {\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../public/bundles'),\n  filename: '[name].bundle.[chunkhash].js',\n  chunkFilename: \"[name].[chunkhash].js\",\n  publicPath: '/bundles/',\n}\n\nmodule.exports = config\n\nLet's add a build option to our package.json:\n{\n\n  ...\n\n  \"scripts\": {\n\n    ...\n\n    \"build\": \"webpack --bail -p --config config/webpack/config.production.js\",\n\n    ...\n\n  },\n\n  ...\n\n}\n\nAnd trigger a build:\n➜ cache-busters yarn build\n\nyarn build v0.22.0\n\n$ webpack — bail -p — config config/webpack/config.production.js\n\nHash: 01788dcc6a43c1f47e5c\n\nVersion: webpack 3.0.0\n\nTime: 1786ms\n\nAsset Size Chunks Chunk Names\n\napp.bundle.9f61f58dd1cc3bb82182.js 688 kB 0 [emitted] [big] app\n\napp.bundle.9f61f58dd1cc3bb82182.css 29 bytes 0 [emitted] app\n\nWe are getting there! Now our bundles have unique hashes. But we have a new problem now; our index.html contains old links to /bundles/app.bundle.js and /bundles/app.bundle.css.\nWe will use html-webpack-plugin to generate our index.html on demand from a template. You can use html-webpack-plugin with various templating engines, so it should cover most of the use cases.\n➜ cache-busters yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin\n\n➜ cache-busters mv public/index.html ./src/assets/index.template.html\n\nRemove bundle links from index.template.html:\n// src/assets/index.template.html\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Cache Busters&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nAdd html-webpack-plugin to Webpack's config.production.js:\nconst path = require('path')\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')\nconst config = require('./config')\n\nconfig.output = {\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../public/bundles'),\n  filename: '[name].bundle.[chunkhash].js',\n  chunkFilename: \"[name].[chunkhash].js\",\n  publicPath: '/bundles/',\n}\n\nconfig.plugins.push(\n  new ExtractTextPlugin({\n    filename: 'app.bundle.[chunkhash].css',\n    allChunks: true\n  }),\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    filename: '../../public/index.html',\n    template: 'src/assets/index.template.html'\n  })\n)\n\nmodule.exports = config\n\nAnd build:\n➜ cache-busters yarn build\n\nyarn build v0.22.0\n\n...\n\nAsset Size Chunks Chunk Names\n\napp.bundle.9f61f58dd1cc3bb82182.js 688 kB 0 [emitted] [big] app\n\napp.bundle.9f61f58dd1cc3bb82182.css 29 bytes 0 [emitted] app\n\npublic/index.html 462 bytes [emitted]\n\n...\n\n➜ cache-busters cat public/index.html\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n\n&lt;html lang=”en”&gt;\n\n  &lt;head&gt;\n\n    ...\n\n    &lt;link href=\"/bundles/app.bundle.9f61f58dd1cc3bb82182.css\" rel=\" stylesheet\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n\n  &lt;body&gt;\n\n    &lt;div id=”app”&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;script type=”text/javascript” src=”/bundles/app.bundle.9f61f58dd1cc3bb82182.js”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nBingo! Our index.html now contains a dynamic chunk hash for both asset files.\nIt's a good idea to add those folders with dynamically generated files to .gitignore so that no one will commit it to git.\nNow we have a new problem; our development build is broken. There's no index.html with our entry point anymore, and we don't want to use chunk hash during development since it's slower. One way to solve this issue would be to create a second public folder for development only with index.html referencing to static app.bundle.js/css assets, but it means we'd have to keep two versions of index.html with the same content.\nBut what if we'd use html-webpack-plugin to generate index.html from the template with chunk hash-free assets? I'd work except for one small issue — using webpack-dev-server, our index.html is not being written to a hard drive. What now? Of course, there is a webpack plugin to solve it: html-webpack-harddisk-plugin!\nNow we can add it to our development config:\n➜ cache-busters yarn add --dev html-webpack-harddisk-plugin\n// config.development.js\n\nconst path = require('path')\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')\nconst HtmlWebpackHarddiskPlugin = require('html-webpack-harddisk-plugin')\nconst config = require('./config')\n\nconfig.output = {\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../public/bundles'),\n  filename: '[name].bundle.js',\n  chunkFilename: \"[name].js\",\n  publicPath: '/bundles/',\n}\n\nconfig.plugins.push(\n  new ExtractTextPlugin({\n    filename: 'app.bundle.css',\n    allChunks: true\n  }),\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    filename: '../../public/index.html',\n    template: 'src/assets/index.template.html',\n    alwaysWriteToDisk: true, // this option was added by html-webpack-harddisk-plugin\n  }),\n  new HtmlWebpackHarddiskPlugin()\n)\n\nmodule.exports = config\n\nTry to run webpack-dev-server:\n➜ cache-busters yarn start\n\n...\n\nAsset Size Chunks Chunk Names\n\napp.bundle.js 1.06 MB 0 [emitted] [big] app\n\napp.bundle.css 37 bytes 0 [emitted] app\n\n../../public/index.html 420 bytes [emitted]\n\nThat's it! Bundles don't have a hash, and index.html is being emitted.\nNow we have working cache-busting as well as a solid Webpack setup ready to be extended.\nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial &amp; see you next time.\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/programming/webpack-cache-bust/","title":"Webpack - cache busting"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/":{"body":"","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/","title":"Uni"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/complex-numbers-notes/":{"body":"Imaginary numbers\nQuadratic equations as $x^2 = -1$ don't have any real number solution.\nThe solution exists in the complex number system.\nBackbone of which is the imaginary unit $i$.

The objects could be anything at all.\nAn element or member is each of the objects in a set.\nElements of the set belong to or are in a set.\nA set can be specified by enclosing a list of elements in curly brackets, e.g.:\n$$\nS = {5, 12, 34, 58}\n$$\nA set can be described, e.g.:\nLet $T$ be the set of all odd integers.\nSets are usually denoted with capital letters.\nEmpty set is denoted with $\n\\emptyset$.\n$\\in$ means is in and $\\notin$ means is not in.\nAn intersection is a process of forming new set out of overlapping members of two or more sets and is denoted as $A \\cap B$.\nUnion is a process of forming new set out of all the members of two or more sets and is denoted as $A \\cup B$.\n$A$ is a subset of $B$ when every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. A subset is denoted as $A \\subseteq B$.\nEvery set is a subset of itself and the empty set is a subset of every set.\nThe set of all real number is denoted as $\\mathbb{R}$.\nAn interval is a set of real numbers that correspond to a continuous section of number line.\nAn endpoint is a number that lies at the end of an interval.\nThe whole set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is an interval with no endpoints.\nClosed is such interval that includes all of its endpoints.\nOpen interval doesn't include any of its endpoints.\nHalf-open interval includes only one of its endpoints.\n$\\mathbb{R}$ doesn't have endpoints, so it's both open and closed.\nInequality signs can be used to describe intervals.\nInterval notation can also describe intervals e.g.:\n$$\n4 \\le x &lt; 7\n$$\nis denoted as:\n$$\n[4, 7)\n$$\nAn interval that extends indefinitely is denoted by $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$.\nUnion of intervals can be described as e.g.:\n$$\n(-\\infty, 2] \\cup [4, 6)\n$$\n1.2 What is a function?\nA function consists of:\n\na set of allowed input values, called the domain of the function\na set of values in which every output value lies, called the codomain of the function\na process, called the rule of the function, for converting each input value into exactly one output value.\n\nA function can be denoted with function notation, e.g.:\n$$\nh(x) = x^2\n$$\nThe image set is a set of values in the codomain that do occur as output values.\nEvery value in the domain of a function must have exactly one output value.\nIf $f$ is a function, and $x$ is any value in its domain, then the value $f(x)$ is called the image of $x$ under $f$, or the value of $f$ at $x$, or $f$ maps $x$ to $f$.\nReal functions have domain and codomain consisting of real numbers.\n1.3 Specifying functions\nFunction specification consists of its domain and rule, e.g.:\n$$\nf(x) = x^{2}+ 1 ~~ (0 \\le x \\le 6)\n$$\nor\n$$\nf(x) = x^{2}+ 1 ~~ (x \\in [0, 6])\n$$\nWhen a function is specified by just a rule, it's understood that the domain of the function is the largest possible set of real numbers for which the rule is applicable.\n1.4 Graphs of functions\nis the set of points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane such that $x$ is in the domain of $f$ and $y = f(x)$.\nFunctions increasing or decreasing on an interval\nA function $f$ is increasing on the interval $I$ if for all values $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$ such that $x_1 &lt; x_2$,\n$$\nf(x_1) &lt; f(x_2)\n$$\nA function $f$ is decreasing on the interval $I$ if for all values $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$ such that $x_1 &lt; x_2$,\n$$\nf(x_1) &gt; f(x_2)\n$$\n(The interval $I$ must be part of the domain of $f$.)\n1.5 Image sets of functions\nIn the same way as a domain of function can be visualized on the $x$-axis the image set of a function can be visualized on the $y$-axis.\nThe image set consists of all the possible output numbers, that is, all the points on the $y$-axis that lie directly to the right or left of a point on the graph.\n1.6 Some standard types of functions\n\nLinear functions - has the rule of the form $f(x) = mx + c$.\nConstant function - a linear function whose rule is of the form $f(x) = c$.\nQuadratic functions - has the rule of the form $f(x) = ax^{2} + bx + c$.\n\nPolynomial functions\nLinear and quadratic functions are particular types of polynomial functions. Other example of polynomial function is:\n$$\nf(x) = 2x^{4} - 5x^{3} + x^{2} + 2x - 3\n$$\nIn general, a polynomial expression in $x$ is any expression that is a sum of finitely many terms, each of which is of the form $ax^{n}$ where $a$ is a number and $n$ is a non-negative integer.\nDegree of a polynomial expression or function is the highest power of the variable $x$ in it.\nQuadratic functions are polynomial functions of degree 2.\nLinear functions are polynomial functions of degree 1, 0 or no degree at all.\nPolynomial functions of degrees 3, 4, and 5 are called\n\ncubic\nquartic\nquintic\n\nfunctions, respectively\nEvery polynomial function (with domain $\\mathbb{R}$) that isn't a constant function tends to infinity or tends to minus infinity at the left and right.\nDominant term is a term in a rule of function with the highest power of $x$ and it defines whether the function tends to infinity or minus infinity. It's called dominant because it outweights (dominates) the sum of the values taken by all other temrs for large values of $x$.\nIf the dominant term has a plus sign and\n\ncontains an even power of $x$, then the graph tends to infinity at both ends.\ncontains an odd power of $x$, then the graph tends to minus infinity at the left and to infinity at the right.\n\nIf the dominant term has a minus sign and\n\ncontains an even power of $x$, then the graph tends to minus infinity at both ends.\ncontains an odd power of $x$, then the graph tends to infinity at the left and to minus infinity at the right.\n\nThe modulus function\nThe modulus of a real number (or magnitude, absolute value) is its 'distance from zero' and for a real number $x$ its denoted as  $|x|$.\nTHe modulus function is\n$$\nf(x) = |x|\n$$\nIt follows form the definition that\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n|x| = \\begin{cases}\nx \\quad &amp;\\text{if} , x \\ge 0 \\\n-x \\quad &amp;\\text{if} , x &lt; 0 \\\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\nSo the graph of the modulus function is the same as the graph of $y = x$ when $x \\ge 0$ and same as the graph of $y = -x$ when $x &lt; 0$. It has a corner at the origin and image set of $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe reciprocal function\nIf $x$ is any non-zero number, then the reciprocal of $x$ is $1/x$.\nThe reciprocal function is\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nWith the domain of $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)$.\nIt forms following graph\n\nIf a curve has a property when it gets arbitrarily close to straight line as it gets further away from origin then the straight line is called the asymptote of the curve.\nHence the coordinate axes are asymptotes of the graph of the reciprocal function.\nRational functions\nThe reciprocal and all polynomial functions are particular examples of rational functions.\nThe rational function is a function whose rule is of the form\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\n$$\nwhere $p$ and $q$ are polynomial functions.\nf is polynomial function when $q$ is a constant function.\nf is a reciprocal function when $p(x) = 1$ and $q(x) = x$.\n2 New functions from old functions\n2.1 Translating the graphs of functions\nA translation of a shape means sliding it to different position without rotating or reflecting it.\nSuppose that $f$ is a function and $c$ is a constant. To obtain the graph of:\n\n$y = f(x) + c$, translate the graph of $y = f(x)$ up by $c$ units (the translation is down if $c$ is negative)\n$y = f(x - c)$, translate the graph of $y = f(x)$ to the right by $c$ units (the translation is to the left if $c$ is negative).\n\n\nA translations can be combined. An equation $y = f(x)$ can be moved $c$ units to the right by replacing $x$ as $y = f(x - c)$. A shift up can be achieved by adding a constant $d$:\n$$\ny = f(x - c) + d\n$$\nHence the original equation is translated to the right by $c$ units and up by $d$ units. Order of operations doesn't matter.\n2.2 Scaling the graphs of functions vertically\nConstant multiple is a function obtained by multiplying the RHS of a function rule by a constant, e.g. $g(x) = 8x^3$ is a constant multiple of the function $f(x)= x^3$.\nThe resulting effect on the graph of function is called the vertical scaling.\nVertical scaling of graphs\nSuppose that $c$ is a constant. To obtain the graph of $y = cf(x)$, scale the graph of $y = f(x)$ vertically by a factor of $c$.\n\nNegative of a function $f$ is the result of multiplying the right-hand side of the rule of a function $f$ by $-1$.\nVertical scaling can be combined with vertical and/or horizontal translations of graphs, e.g. $y = 4x^{3}+ 1$ scales the equation $y = x^3$ vertically by $4$ units, then translates it up by $1$ unit.\nThe order of operations does often matter.\n2.3 Scaling the graphs of functions horizontally\nThe horizontal scaling is achieved by replacing each occurrence of the input variable $x$ in the right-hand side of the rule of a function by an expression of the form $x/c$, where $c$ is constant.\nThe resulting effect on the graph of a function is called horizontal scaling.\nHorizontal scalings of graphs\nSuppose that $c$ is a non-zero constant. To obtain the graph of \n$$\ny = f(\\frac{x}{c})\n$$\nscale the graph of $y = f(x)$ horizontally by a factor of $c$.\n\nReflections of graphs in the coordinate axes\nTo obtain the graph of $y = -f(x)$, reflect the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the $x$-axis.\nTo obtain the graph of $y = f(-x)$, reflect the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the $y$-axis.\n\n3 More new functions from old functions\n3.1 Sums, differences, products and quotients of functions\nSuppose that $f$ and $g$ are functions.\n\nThe sum has the rule $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$\nThere are two differences\n\n$h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$\n$h(x) = g(x) - f(g)$\n\n\nThe product has the rule $h(x) = f(x)g(x)$\nThere are two quotients\n\n$h(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$\n$h(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{f(x)}$\n\n\n\n3.2 Composite functions\nSuppose $f$ and $g$, if the output of $f$ lies in the domain of $g$ it can be input to it.\nflowchart LR\n\tinput&gt;x]\n\toutput&gt;\"g(f(x))\"]\n\t input --&gt; f --&gt;|\"f(x)\"| g --&gt; output\nA composite function is function whose rule is given by this process and whose domain is the largest set of real numbers to which you can apply the process.\nIt's denoted by $g \\circ f$ (the function that is applied first is second in the notation).\nDefinition of composite functions\nSuppose that $f$ and $g$ are functions. The composite function $g \\circ f$ is the function whose rule is\n$$\n(g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))\n$$\nand whose domain consists of all the values $x$ in the domain of $f$ such that $f(x)$ is in the domain of $g$.\nThe process of forming a composite function from two functions is called composing the functions.\nFunctions $f$ and $g$ have two composite functions\n\n$g \\circ f$, meaning apply $f$ first, than $g$\n$f \\circ g$, meaning apply $g$ first, than $f$\n\n3.3 Inverse functions\nThe inverse function of a function $f$, which is denoted by $f^{-1}$, is the function whose mapping diagram is obtained by reversing the direction of all the arrows in this full version of diagram.\nflowchart LR\n\tx --&gt; |f| y\n\ty --&gt; |f^-1| x\nOne-to-one functions\nA function $f$ is one-to-one if fo all values $x_1$ and $x_2$ in its domain such that $x_1 \\ne x_2$,\n$$\nf(x_1) \\ne f(x_2)\n$$\nOnly one-to-one functions have inverse functions.\nInvertible function is a function that has an inverse function.\nDefinition of inverse functions\nSuppose that $f$ is one-to-one function, with domain $A$ and image set $B$. Then the inverse function, or simply inverse, of $f$, denoted by $f^{-1}$, is the function with domain $B$ whose rule is given by\n$$\nf^{-1}(y) = x, ~~~~~\\text{where} ~~ f(x) = y\n$$\nThe image set of $f^{-1}$ is $A$.\nStrategy to find the rule of the inverse function of a one-to-one function $f$\n\nWrite $y = f(x)$ and rearrange this equation to express $x$ in terms of $y$.\nUse the resulting equation $x = f^{-1}(y)$ to write down the rule of $f^{-1}$. (Usually, change the input variable from $y$ to $x$.)\n\nIf a function is either increasing on its whole domain, or decreasing on its whole domain, then it is one-to-one and so has an inverse function.\nFor any pair of inverse functions $f$ and $f^{-1}$,\n\n$(f^{-1} \\circ f)(x) = x$, for every value $x$ in the domain of $f$, and \n$(f \\circ f^{-1})(x) = x$, for every value $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$\n\nGraphs of inverse functions\nThe graphs of a pair of inverse functions are the reflections of each other in the line $y = x$ (when the coordinate axes have equal scales).\n\nFunctions that aren't one-to-one\nStarting with a function $f$ that is not one-to-one, specify a new function that has same rule as $f$, but a smaller domain with following conditions satisfied:\n\nthe new function is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse\nthe image set of the new function is the same as the image set of the original function\n\nE.g. for $f(x) = x^{2}$ the new function can be $g(x) = x^{2} ~~ (x \\in [0, \\infty))$.\n$g$ is one-to-one with inverse $g^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{x}$.\nA function like $g$ that is obtained from another function $f$ by removing some numbers from its domain and keeping the rule is called a restriction of the original function $f$.\n4 Exponential functions and logarithms\n4.1 Exponential functions\nIs a function whose rule is of the form\n$$\nf(x) = b^x\n$$\nwhere $b$ is a positive constant, not equal to 1.\n$b$ is called the base number of the exponential function.\n\nGraphs of exponential functions\nThe graph of the function $f(x) = b^{x}$, where $b &gt; 0$ and $b \\ne 1$, has the following features.\n\nThe graph lies entirely above the $x$-axis.\nIf $b &gt; 1$, then the graph is increasing, and it gets steeper as $x$ increases.\nIf $0 &lt; b &lt; 1$, then the graph is decreasing, and it gets less steep as $x$ increases.\nThe $x$-axis is an asymptote.\nThe $y$-intercept is 1.\nThe closer the value of $b$ is to 1, the flatter is the graph.\n\nThe exponential function\nThe graph of every exponential function $f(x) = b^{x}$ passes through the point $(0, 1)$. And its steepness depends on the value of $b$.\n\nThe exponential function with rule $f(x) = e^{x}$ has the special property that its gradient is exactly 1 at the point $(0,1)$, this function is referred to as the exponential function.\n\n4.2 What is a logarithm?\nLogarithms have a particular base\nLogs to base 10 are known as common logarithms with following definition.\nThe logarithm to base 10 of a number $x$ is the power to which 10 must be raised to give the number $x$. e.g.:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\log_{10}100 = 2 \\\\[0.6em]\n\\log_{10}1000 = 3 \\\\[0.6em]\n\\log_{10}(\\frac{1}{10})= -1\n\\end{align}\n$$\nGeneral definition of logarithms\nThe logarithm to base $b$ of a number $x$, denoted by $\\log_bx$, is the power to which the base $b$ must be raised to give the number $x$. So the two equations\n$$\ny = \\log_bx ~~~ \\text{and} ~~~ x = b^y\n$$\nare equivalent.\nRemeber that:\n\nthe base $b$ must be positive and not equal to 1\nonly positive numbers have logarithms, but logarithms themselves can be any number.\n\nLogarithm of the number 1 and logarithm of the base\nFor any base $b$,\n$$\n\\log_b1 = 0 ~~~ \\text{and} ~~~ \\log_bb = 1\n$$\nThe most common bases of logarithms are $2$, $10$ and $e$.\nLogarithms to the base $e$ are called natural logarithms and the notation $\\ln$ is often used.\nNatural logarithms\nThe natural logarithm of a number $x$, denoted by $\\ln x$, is the power to which the base $e$ must be raised to give the number $x$. So the two equations\n$$\ny = \\ln x ~~~\\text{and} ~~~ x = e^y\n$$\nare equivalent.\nNatural logarithms share following properties with common logs\n$$\n\\ln 1 = 0 ~~~ \\text{and} ~~~ \\ln e = 1\n$$\n4.3 Logarithmic functions\nAre functions with a rule of the form\n$$\nf(x) = \\log_b x\n$$\nwhere $b$ is a positive constant, not equal to 1.\nThe logarithmic function $f(x) = \\log_b x$ is the inverse function of the exponential function $g(x) = b^x$ since\n$$\ny = \\log_bx ~~~ \\text{and} ~~~ x = b^y\n$$\nare rearrangements of each other. Hence the graphs of both functions are reflections of each other in the line $y = x$.\n\nGraphs of logarithmic functions\nThe graph of the function $f(x) = \\log_bx$, where $b &gt; 0$ and $b \\ne 1$, has the following features.\n\nThe graph lies entirely to the right of the $y$-axis.\nIf $b &gt; 1$, then the graph is increasing, and it gets less steep as $x$ increases.\nIf $0 &lt; b &lt; 1$, then the graph is decreasing, and it gets less steep as $x$ increases.\nThe $y$-axis is an asymptote.\nThe $x$-intercept is 1.\nThe closer the value of $b$ is to 1, the steeper is the graph.\n\n\nFor any base $b$,\n$$\n\\log_b(b^{x})= x ~~~ \\text{and} ~~~ b^{\\log_bx} = x\n$$\nIn particular,\n$$\n\\ln(e^{x}) = x ~~~ \\text{and} ~~~ e^{\\ln x} = x\n$$\n(A composition of $f(x) = b^{x}$ and $f^{-1}(x) = \\log_bx$)\n4.4 Logarithm laws\nThree logarithm laws\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log_bx + \\log_by = \\log_b(xy) \\\\[0.5em]\n\\log_bx - \\log_by = \\log_b(\\frac{x}{y}) \\\\[0.5em]\nr\\log_bx = log_b(x^r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSolving exponential equations\nAn exponential equation has the unknown in the exponent, e.g.\n$$\n5^{x}= 130\n$$\nAnd the third logarithm law can be used to solve those. It's useful to swap the sides for this purpose:\n$$\n\\log_b(x^{r)}= r\\log_b(x) ~~~ \\text{in particular} ~~~ \\ln(x^{r}) = r\\ln(x)\n$$\n4.5 Alternative form for exponential functions\nAny exponential function $f(x) = b^x$, where $b$ is a positive constant not equal to 1, can be written in the alternative form\n$$\nf(x) = e^{kx}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-zero constant. The constant $k$ is given by $k = \\ln b$.\nThis fact gives following alternative definition of an exponential function\nAn exponential function is a function whose rule is of the form\n$$\nf(x) = e^{kx}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-zero constant.\nAnd properties of exponential graphs can be rewritten as\nGraphs of exponential functions\nThe graph of the function $f(x) = e^{kx}$, where $k \\ne 0$, has the following features.\n\nThe graph lies entirely above the $x$-axis.\nIf $k &gt; 0$, then the graph is increasing, and it gets steeper as $x$ increases.\nIf $k &lt; 0$, then the graph is decreasing, and it gets less steep as $x$ increases.\nThe $x$-axis is an asymptote.\nThe $y$-intercept is 1.\nThe closer the value of $k$ is to 0, the flatter is the graph.\n\n\nThe graph of every exponential function is a horizontal scaling of the graph of the exponential function $f(x) = e^x$.\n4.6 Exponential models\nAre defined by a function with rule of the form $f(x) = ab^{x}$. That is equal to $f(x) = ae^{kx}$ in the alternative form.\n$f(x) = ae^{kx}$ is obtained by\n\nvertically scaling the graph of the function $g(x) = e^{kx}$ by the factor of $a$.\n\n$g(x) = e^{kx}$ is obtained by\n\nhorizontally scaling the graph of the function $h(x) = e^{kx}$ by a factor of $1/k$.\n\nHence the graph of the function $f(x) = ae^{kx}$ is obtained by scaling the graph of the function $h(x) = e^x$ both horizontally and vertically.\n\nA quantity is changed exponentially when the change can be modeled by a function with rule of the the form $f(x) = ae^{kx}$.\nIf $a$ and $k$ are positive then the quantity is said to grow exponentially and the function is called exponential growth function.\nIf $a$ is positive but $k$ is negative then it's said the quantity decays exponentially, the function is exponential decay function and graph is called an exponential decay curve.\nA characteristic property of exponential growth and decay functions\nIf $f(x) = ae^{kx}$, then whenever $p$ units are added to the value of $x$, the value of $f(x)$ is multiplied by $e^{kp}$\nThe reason is following. Say the value of $x$ changes from\n$$\nf(x) = ae^{kx} ~~~ \\text{to} ~~~ f(x + p) = ae^{k(x + p)}\n$$\nThen\n$$\nae^{k(x + p)} = a^{kx + kp} = ae^{kx}e^{kp} = f(x) \\times e^{kp}\n$$\nThe factor by which $f(x)$ is multiplied is called growth or decay factor.\n\nGrowth factors are $&gt; 1$\nDecay factors are between 0 and 1, exclusive.\n\nDoubling and halving periods\nSuppose that $f$ is an exponential growth function.

Hence the gradient of the graph at $(1, 1)$ must bey exactly 2.\nExpressed mathematically as\n$2 + h$ tends to $2$ as $h$ tends to $0$\nor\nthe limit of $2 + h$ as $h$ tends to zero is $2$.\nMore generic formula can be devised as\n\n$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gradient} &amp;= \\frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{(x + h) - x} \\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{x + h - x} \\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{2xh + h^2}{h} \\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{h(2x + h)}{h} \\\\\n&amp;= 2x + h\n\\end{align*}$\nAs the second point gets closer and closer to the original point, the value of $h$ gets closer and closer to $0$ and the gradient gets closer and closer to $2x$.\nSo the gradient of the graph of $y = x^2$ at the point whose $x$-coordinate is denoted by $x$ is given by the formula\n$$\n\\text{gradient} = 2x\n$$\n1.4 Derivatives\nConsider a function $f$ and input value $x$.\nThe point on the graph of $f$ that corresponds to $x$ is $(x, f(x))$.\nIf the graph of $f$ has a gradient at that point, then we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$.\nIt's convenient to think about various gradients of a function $f$  as defining a new function that is related to $f$.\nThe rule of the new function is:\n\nIf the input value is $x$, then the output value is the gradient of the graph of $f$ at the point $(x, f(x))$.\n\nThis new function is called the derivative (or derived function) of the function $f$ and is denoted by $f'$.\nThe domain of $f'$ consists of all the values at which $f$ is differentiable.\nDifferentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a given function $f$.\nThe value of the derivative of a function $f$ at a particular input value $x$ is called the derivative of $f$ at $x$.\nDifferentiation from first principle\nSuppose $f$ and $x$ in the domain of $f$ such that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ (the graph of $f$ has a gradient at $(x, f(x))$). Consider second point with the offset of $h$, then:\n\nThe gradient of the  line that passes through the two points is given by\n$$\n\\text{gradient} = \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{(x + h) - x} = \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\n$$\nThis expression is known as the difference quotient for the function $f$ at the value $x$.\nAs the value of $h$ gets closer and closer to zero, the value of the difference quotient gets closer and closer to the gradient of the graph at the point $(x, f(x))$, that is $f'(x)$.\nTo find the formula for $f'(x)$ I need to find, in terms of $x$, the limit of the difference quotient as $h$ tends to zero. In other words, I need to consider what happens to the difference quotient for $f$ at $x$, as $h$ gets closer and closer to zero.\nSaying that a function $f$ is differentiable at a particular value of $x$ is the same as saying that the difference quotient for $f$ at $x$ tends to a limit as $h$ tends to zero. It must tend to the same limit for positive values of $h$ as for negative values.\nFor any function $f$, the derivative $f'$ of $f$ is given by the equation\n$$\nf'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(x + h) - f(x) }{ h }\n$$\nfor each value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ for which this limit exists.\nLeibniz notation\nThe notation with $f'$ denoting the derivative of a function $f$ is called Lagrange notation or prime notation. Leibniz notation is other extensively used notation.\nIn general, Lagrange notation is used when thinking in terms of a variable, and a function of this variable. Leibniz notation is used when thinking more of the relationship between two variables.\nConsider $y = x^2$, formula for its gradient is $\\text{gradient} = 2x$.\nIn Leibniz notation this equation is written as\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{d}y}{\\text{d}x} = 2x\n$$\nOften referred to as the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$.\nIt's important to mention that\n\nThe notation is not a fraction\n$\\text{d}$ doesn't have any meaning outside of the notation\n$\\text{d}$ is not a factor\n\nThe usefulness of the Leibniz notation can be demonstrated as follows\n\nThe emphasis is on the relationship between the variables $x$ and $y$, rather than on the idea of $f$ as a function of $x$.\nChange in the $x$- and $y$-coordinate is denoted by $\\delta x$ and $\\delta y$ respectively. \n$\\delta$ (delta) indicates 'a small change in'.\nSo the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of second point are $x + \\delta x$ and $y + \\delta y$ respectively.\nThe gradient of the line that passes through he two points is then\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}\n$$\nThe gradient is the limit of $\\delta y / \\delta x$ as the second point gets closer and closer to the first point.\nFunctions whose domains include endpoints\nAny function whose domain includes an endpoint isn't differentiable at this endpoint.\nE.g. $f(x) = x^{3/2}$ has domain $[0, \\infty)$:\n\nThe endpoint at $0$ (at the origin) can be approached from right but can't from left. Hence the graph doesn't have tangent at the origin, it's not differentiable at $x = 0$.\nBut the graph has a 'gradient on the right' at origin, namely $0$.\nSo we can say that the function $f(x) = x^{3/2}$ is right-differentiable at $x=0$, and that its right derivative at 0 is 0.\nSummary of derivatives\nThe derivative (or derived function) of a function $f$ is the function $f'$ such that\n$$\nf'(x) = \\text{gradient of the graph of } f~ \\text{at the point } (x, f(x))\n$$\nThe domain of $f'$ consists of the values in the domain of $f$ at which $f$ is differentiable (that is, the $x$-values that give points at which the gradient exists).\nIf $y = f(x)$, then $f'(x)$ is also denoted by $\\frac{\\text{d}y}{\\text{d}x}$.\nThe derivative $f'$ is given by the equation\n$$\nf'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(x + h) - f(x) }{ h }\n$$\nThe procedure of using this equation to find a formula for the derivative $f'$ is called differentiation from first principles.\n2 Finding derivatives of simple functions\n2.1 Derivatives of power functions\nAny functions of the form $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a real number, is called a power function.\nPreviously seen formulas for the derivatives of three power functions are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}(x^2) = 2x, ~~~\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}(x^3) = 3x^2, ~~~\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}(x^4) = 4x^3\n$$\nThey all follow the same pattern:\nDerivative of a power function\nFor any number $n$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}(x^n) = nx^{n -1}\n$$\nThis formula holds for all values of $n$, including negative and fractional values.\n$f(x) = x$  has derivative $f'(x) = 1 \\times x^0$; that is$f'(x) = 1$.\n$f(x) = 1$ (same as $f(x) = x^0$) has derivative $f'(x) = 0$.\n2.2 Constant multiple rule\nIf any graph is scaled vertically by a particular factor, then its gradient at any particular $x$-value is multiplied by this factor.\nScaling a graph by a factor of 3:\n\nConstant multiple rule (Lagrange notation)\nIf the function $k$ is given by $k(x) = af(x)$, where $f$ is a function and $a$ is a constant, then\n$$\nk'(x) = af'(x)\n$$\nfor all values of $x$ at which $f$ is differentiable.\nConstant multiple rule (Leibniz notation)\nIf $y = au$, where $u$ is a function of $x$ and $a$ is a constant, then\n$$\n\\frac{ \\text{d}y }{ \\text{d}x } = a\\frac{ \\text{d}u }{ \\text{d}x } \n$$\nfor all values of $x$ at which $u$ is differentiable.\nDerivative of a constant function\nIf $a$ is a constant, then\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}(a) = 0\n$$\n2.3 Sum rule\nWhen two functions are added, then the $y$-coordinates of the points on the two graphs are added.\n\nIf I add two functions, then the gradient of the sum function at any particular $x$-value is the sum of the gradients of the two original functions at that $x$-value.\nE.g.:\n\nSum rule (Lagrange notation)\nIf $k(x) = f(x) + g(x)$, where $f$ and $g$ are functions, then\n$$\nk'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)\n$$\nfor all values of $x$ at which both $f$ and $g$ are differentiable.\nSum rule (Leibniz notation)\nIf $y = u + v$, where $u$ and $v$ are functions of $x$, then\n$$\n\\frac{ \\text{d}y }{ \\text{d}x } =\n\\frac{ \\text{d}u }{ \\text{d}x } + \\frac{ \\text{d}v }{ \\text{d}x }\n$$\nEvery polynomial function (with domain $\\mathbb{R}$) is differentiable at every value of $x$.\n3 Rates of change\nThe idea of a gradient as a rate of change applies to curved graphs. However the rate of change is 'instantaneous' value.\nAnother way to think about the derivative $\\text{d}y/\\text{d}x$ is that it is the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.\n3.1 Displacement and velocity\nRelationship between displacement and velocity\nSuppose that an object is moving along a straight line. If $t$ is the time that has elapsed since some chosen point in time, $s$ is the displacement of the object from some chosen reference point, and $v$ is the velocity of the object, then\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\text{d}s}{\\text{d}t}\n$$\n(Time, displacement and velocity can be measured in any suitable units, as long as they're consistent).\n4 Finding where functions are increasing, decreasing or stationary\nBecause the derivative of a function gives the gradient at each point on the graph of the function, it gives information about the shape of the graph.\n4.1 Increasing/decreasing criterion\nFunctions increasing or decreasing on an interval\nA function $f$ is increasing on the interval $I$ if for all values $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$ such that $x_1 &lt; x_2$\n$$\nf(x_1) &lt; f(x_2)\n$$\nA function $f$ is decreasing on the interval $I$ if for all values $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$ such that $x_1 &lt; x_2$\n$$\nf(x_1) &gt; f(x_2)\n$$\n(The interval $I$ must be part of the domain of $f$.)\nIncreasing/decreasing criterion\nIf $f'(x)$ is positive for all $x$ in an interval $I$, then $f$ is increasing on $I$.\nIf $f'(x)$ is negative for all $x$ in an interval $I$, then $f$ is decreasing on $I$.\nStationary points\nThe gradient of $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 36x$ is\n\npositive on the interval $(-\\infty, -2)$\nnegative on the interval $(-2, 3)$\npositive on the interval $(3, \\infty)$\n\nBetween these open intervals, there are points at which the gradient of the graph is zero. Such a point is called a stationary point.\n\nAt the left-hand stationary point the value taken by the function is larger than at any other point nearby, hence the function has a local maximum at this point.\nSimilarly the function has a local minimum a the right-hand point.\nTurning point is a point where a function has a local maximum or local minimum.\nA stationary point of functions as:\n\nwhen the graph of a functions is constantly decreasing or increasing, is called a horizontal point of inflection.\nStrategy to fund the stationary points of a function $f$\nSolve the equation $f'(x) = 0$\nFirst derivative test (for determining the nature of a stationary point of a function $f$)\nIf there are open intervals immediately to the left and right of a stationary point such that\n\n$f'(x)$ is positive on the left interval and negative on the right interval, then the stationary point is a local maximum\n$f'(x)$ is negative on the left interval and positive on the right interval, then the stationary point is a local minimum\n$f'(x)$ is positive on both intervals or negative on both intervals, then the stationary point is a horizontal point of inflection.\n\nStrategy to apply the first derivative test by choosing sample points\n\nChoose two points (that is, two $x$-values) fairly close to the stationary point, one on each side.\nCheck that the function is differentiable at all points between the chosen points and the stationary point, and that there are no other stationary points between the chosen points and the stationary point.\nFind the value of the derivative of the function at the two chosen points.\n\nIf the derivative is positive at the left chosen point and negative at the right chosen point, then the stationary point is a local maximum.\nIf the derivative is negative at the left chosen point and positive at the right chosen point, then the stationary point is a local minimum.\nIf the derivative is positive at both chosen points or negative at both chosen points, then the stationary point is a horizontal point of inflection.\n\n\n\n4.3 Uses of finding stationary points\nProperties of graphs of cubic functions\nThe graph of every cubic function has the following properties.\n\nThere are two, one or no stationary points\nApart from at any stationary points and in the interval between them if there are two,\n\nthe graph slopes up from left to right if the coefficient of $x^3$ in the rule of the function is positive\nthe graph slopes down from left to right if the coefficient of $x^3$ is negative.\n\n\nIf there are two stationary points, then one is a local maximum and the other is a local minimum, and the graph slopes the other way in the interval between them. \nIf there is one stationary point, then it is a horizontal point of inflection.\nThere are three, two or one $x$-intercepts.\nThere is one $y$-intercept.\nThe graph tends to plus or minus infinity for large positive and large negative values of $x$.\n\nFinding the greatest and least values of a function an interval of the form $[a, b]$\n(This strategy is valid when the function is continuous on the interval, and differentiable at all values in the interval except possibly the endpoints.)\n\nFind the stationary points of the function.\nFind the values of the function at any stationary points inside the interval, and at the endpoints of the  interval.\nFind the greatest or least of the function values found.\n\n5 Differentiating twice\n5.1 Second derivative\nThe derivative of a function is itself a function, sometimes called the derived function. Meaning it can itself be differentiable.\nThe second derivative (or second derived function) is the function  that is obtained by differentiating a function twice.\nIn Lagrange notation, the second derivative of a function $f$ is denoted by $f''$.\nIn Leibniz notation, the second derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is denoted by:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\n$$\nWith following reasoning:\nThe second derivative can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{d}{dx}y)\n$$\nWhich was historically abbreviated as\n$$\n(\\frac{d}{dx})^2y~,\\text{and then to}~~ \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\n$$\nThe domain of the second derivative of a function consists of all the values of $x$ at which its first derivative is differentiable. It's said that the original function is twice-differentiable at such values of $x$.\nThird, forth, Nth derivative can be taken in same way.\nThe derivative of a function is sometimes called its first derivative. Hence the word 'first' in 'first derivative test'.\nDerivative of a function tells the gradient of the graph of the function. So the second derivative tells the gradient of the graph of the first derivative.\nHence the second derivative also gives an information about the shape of the graph of the original function.\nE.g. suppose an interval on which the second derivative of a particular function is positive. \nBy the increasing/decreasing criterion, this means that the first derivative is increasing on that interval. In other words, the gradient of the graph of the original function is increasing on that interval.\nMeaning that the shape of the graph of the original function on the interval must be something like:\n\nAll of these are sections of the graphs with increasing gradient.\nA section of a graph shaped like one of the diagrams above is said to be concave up.\nA graph is concave up on an interval if the tangents to the graph on that interval lie below the graph:\n\nWhen there is an interval on which the second derivative of a particular function is negative then, by the increasing/decreasing criterion, the first derivative is decreasing on that interval. Meaning the shape of the graph of the original function on the interval must be something like:\n\nA section of a graph shaped like this is said to be concave down.\nA graph is concave down on an interval if the tangents to the graph on that interval lie above the graph:\n\nSometimes, the words convex and concave are used instead of concave up and concave down, respectively.\nA point where a graph changes from concave up to concave down or vice versa is called a point of inflection. E.g. $f(x) = x^3$ has a point of inflection at the origin:\n\nIf the gradient of a graph at a point of inflection is zero, then the point is a horizontal point of inflection. Otherwise the point is a slant point of inflection.\nConcave up/concave down criterion\nIf $f''(x)$ is positive for all $x$ in an interval $I$, then $f$ is concave up on $I$.\nIf $f''(x)$ is negative for all $x$ in an interval $I$, then $f$ is concave down on $I$.\nSecond derivative test (for determining the nature of a stationary point)\nIf, at a stationary point of a function, the value of the second derivative of the function is\n\nnegative, then the stationary point is a local maximum\npositive, then the stationary point is a local minimum\n\nWhen the value of the second derivative at a stationary point is zero then I can't use the second derivative test to determine the nature of the stationary point.\n5.2 Rates of change of rates of change\nRelationship between displacement, velocity and acceleration\nSuppose that an object is moving in a straight line. If $t$ is the time that has elapsed since some chosen point in time, and $s$, $v$ and $a$ are the displacement, velocity and acceleration of the object, respectively, then\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\text{d}s}{\\text{d}t}, ~~\na = \\frac{\\text{d}v}{\\text{d}t}, ~~\na = \\frac{\\text{d}^2s}{\\text{d}t^2}\n$$\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mst124-unit6/","title":"MST124 Unit 6 - Differentiation"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mu123-unit10/":{"body":"Introduction\nEquation of the form:\n$$\ny = ax^2 +bx + c\n$$\nwhere $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants with $a \\ne 0$, are examined in this unit.\nThe RHS is a quadratic expression and graphs of these equations have a curved shape called parabola.\n1 Introducing parabolas\n1.1 Parabolas everywhere\nThe free-fall equation\nThe relationship between the distance $d$ fallen by an object and the time $t$ that it has been falling is given by\n$$\nd = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\n$$\nwhere the constant $g$ is the acceleration  due to gravity, which is about $9.8 \\text{m/s}^2$.\nOr more compactly:\n$$\nd = 4.9t^2\n$$\nParabola - a part of a parabola is formed by curved shape in the free-fall equation.\nParabolic curve - a curve whose shape is all or part of a parabola.\nDefinitions of a parabola\n\nA shape obtained when a plane \"parallel\" to the side of a cone intersects the cone.\nA shape of the graph of any equation of the form:\n$$\ny = ax^2 +bx + c\n$$\nwhere $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants with $a \\ne 0$.

After great enough distance the air resistance will cause the speed of falling object to stop increasing - to become constant. This is known as the terminal velocity.\nQuadratic model\nAny model based on an equation of form $y = ax^2 +bx + c$.\n1.2 Projectiles\nAn object that is propelled through space by a force that ceases after launch.\nTrajectory is the path a projectile follows.\nBallistics is the science of projectiles.\n1.3 Stopping distances\n2 Graphs of quadratic functions\nEvery parabola has an axis of symmetry cutting the parabola at exactly one point - the vertex.\nA rule that takes input values and produces output values is called a function.\nA function of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is called a quadratic function.\n2.1 Graphs of equations of the form $y = ax^2$\nThe magnitude of $a$ affects how narrow the graph is.

The tables gave the power of ten corresponding to each number that might need to be multiplied - called the logarithms of the numbers.\nThe tables were also used to find the ordinary number corresponding to each ower - antilogarithms of the powers.\n4.2 Logarithms to base 10\nAs mentioned, the logarithm of a number is the power to which 10 must be raised to give the number. Such logarithms are called logarithms to base since 10 has been chosen as the base.\nLogarithms to base 10 are also called common logarithms.\nFollowing common logarithm (in mathematical notation):\n$$\n\\log_{10}100 = 2\n$$\nis described as \"the logarithm to base 10 of 100 equals 2\".\nIt also applies that following statements\n$10^2 = 100$ and $\\log_{10}100 = 2$\nare equivalent.\nIn summary, logarithms to base 10 of a number $x$, denoted by $\\log_{10}x$, is the power to which you have to raise $10$ to get the answer $x$. \nThe subscript 10 can be omitted when\n\nit is understood that a logarithm is a common logarithm.\nWhen the notation is used in an equation involing logarithms that is true no matter what the base is.\n\nRaising 10 to a number and finding the logarithm of a number to base 10 are inverse operations.\n4.4 Logarithms to other bases\nThe logarithm to base $b$ of a number $x$, denoted by $\\log_bx$, is the power to which you have to raise the base $b$ to get the anser $x$. So the two equations\n$x = b^y$ and $y = log_bx$\nare equivalent.\nGiven that\n\nThe base $b$ must be positive and not equal to 1.\nOnly positive numbers have logarithms, but logarithsm themselves can be any number\n\nEuler's number $e$ is often used as a base for logarithms, called natural logarithms. The notation $\\ln$ is usually used in place of $\\log_e$, hence, e.g. the natural logarithm of 5 is written as\n$$\n\\ln5\n$$\nHence the natural logarithm of a number $x$, denoted by $\\ln x$, is the power to which you have to rase the base $e$ to get the answer $x$. So the two equations\n$x = e^y$ and $y = \\ln x$\nare equivalent.\nLogarithm of the number one and logarithm of the base\nFor any base $b$,\n$\\log_b1=0$ and $\\log_bb=1$\n5 Working with logarithms\n5.1 Three logarithm laws\nRule for addition of logarithms\n$$\n\\log x + \\log y = \\log(xy)\n$$\nFormal proof\nSuppose that the numbers $x$ and $y$ can be written as $b^m$ and $b^n$, that is\n$x = b^m$ and $y = b^n$\nThen\n$m = \\log_bx$ and $n = \\log_by$\nThe product $xy$ can be written as\n$xy = b^m \\times b^n = b^{m + n}$\nThis means that the power to which $b$ must be raised to give $xy$ is $m + n$, that is\n$\\log_b(xy) = m + n = \\log_bx + \\log_by$\nwhich is the logarithm law above.\nRule for subtraction of logarithms\n$$\n\\log x - \\log y = log (\\frac{x}{y})\n$$\nFormal proof\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nx &amp;= b^m ~~~ y = b^n \\\\[1em]\nm &amp;= \\log_bx ~~~ n = \\log_by \\\\[1em]\n\\frac{x}{y} &amp;= \\frac{b^m}{b^n} = b^{m - n} \\\\[1em]\n\\log_b(\\frac{x}{y}) &amp;= m - n = \\log_bx - \\log_by \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\nRule for a multiple of a logarithm\n$$\nn \\log x = \\log (x^n)\n$$\nFormal proof\nSuppose that\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nx &amp;= b^m \\\\[1em]\nm &amp;= \\log_bx \\\\[1em]\n\\end{align}\n$$\nThe power $x^n$ can be written as\n$$\nx^n = (b^m)^n = b^{m + n} \\\\[1em]\n$$\nHence the power to which $b$ must be raised to give $x^n$ is $mn$, that is\n$$\n\\log_b(x^n) = mn = n\\log_bx\n$$\nWhich is the logarithm law above.\n5.2 Solving exponential equations by taking logs\nExponential equations is an equation where the unknown is in an exponent, e.g.\n$$\n170 \\times 1.23^t = 7 000 000 000\n$$\nBasic procedure for solving such equations is to take the logarithm of both sides and then applying the logarithm law $\\log(x^n) = n\\log x$.\nThis method works the best when one side of the equation consists only of a number raised to an exponent containing unknown. An equation of different form shoud be rearranged.\nLogarithmic identity\n$$\n\\ln(e^x) = x\n$$\nand\n$$\ne^{\\ln x} = x\n$$\nThese hold for bases other than $e$.\n5.3 Doubling and halving times\nFor any quantity that is subject to continuous exponential growth over time, there will be a particular length of time in which its size always doubles.

All of the factors here are primes.\nI could've started with different nodes, e.g. $360 = 10 \\times 36$, but the result would've been the same.\nThe process of writing a natural number as a product of factors &gt; 1 is called factorisation.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic\nEvery natural number &gt; 1 can be written as product of prime numbers in just one way.\n\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is the product of prime factors that is equal to it, e.g.:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 &amp;= 2 \\qquad 3 = 3 \\qquad 4 = 2^2 \\\\\n5 &amp;= 5 \\qquad 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\qquad 7 = 7 \\\\\n8 &amp;= 2^3 \\qquad 9 = 3^2 \\qquad 10 = 2 \\times 5\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nBecause of the fundamental theorem of aithmetic we can say that prime numbers are the building blocks of natural numbers.\nFor prime factorisation it may be helpful to be systematic and follow:\n$$\n\\text{the smallest possible prime} \\times \\text{a number}\n$$\nAnd iterate for each composite number in the factor tree, e.g.:\ngraph TD;\n    two1((2))\n    two2((2))\n    three1((3))\n    three2((3))\n    seven1((5))\n\t\n\t252--&gt;two1;\n    252--&gt;126;\n\t126--&gt;two2;\n\t126--&gt;63;\n\t63--&gt;three1;\n\t63--&gt;21;\n\t21--&gt;three2;\n\t21--&gt;seven1;\nThere's no other way to find prime factors of a number $n$ then trying all the primes &lt; $n$.\nSo multiplying two large primes is a quick process but expensive to reverse.\nThis fact is a base to secure encryption systems.\nFinding LCM and HCF using prime factors\n\nFind the prime factorisation of the numbers.\nTo find the LCM, multiply together the highest ower of each prime factor occuring in any of the numbers.\nTo find the HCF, multiply together the lowest power of each prime factor common to all the numbers.\n\n1.5 Powers\nIndex laws\nSo far I've used these\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na^m \\times a^n &amp;= a^{m+n} \\qquad \\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \\\\\n(a^m)^n &amp;= a^{mn} \\\\\n(a \\times b)^n &amp;= a^n \\times b^n \\qquad (\\frac{a}{b})^n = \\frac{a^n}{b^n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n2 Rational numbers\nInclude natural numbers among others.\nIs a number that can be written as a fraction of two integers: $\\frac{integer}{integer}$.\nFollowing numbers can be written in this form:\n\nFraction as $\\frac{3}{4}$\nMixed number as $5\\frac{3}{4}$ since it can be converted to top-heavy fraction: $\\frac{23}{4}$\nWhole number: $7 = \\frac{7}{1}$\nDecimal number with finite number of digits after decimal points: $0.42 = \\frac{42}{100}$\nSome decimal numbers with infinite numbers after decimal point: $0.333\\ldots = \\frac{1}{3}$\nThe negative of any above: $-4 = \\frac{-4}{1}$\n\nIrrational numbers\n\n$\\pi$\n$\\sqrt{2}$\n\nRational numbers as decimals\nEvery rational number can be converted to decimal, e.g.: $\\frac{5}{8} = 5 \\div 8 = 0.625$\nThere are two possible outcomes of the division:\n\ndecimal number with finite digits after d.p. - terminating decimal\n\n$0.625$ is terminating\n\n\ndecimal with block of indefinitely repeating digits after d.p - recurring decimal\n\n$\\frac{2}{3} = 0.6666\\ldots$ is recurring\nCan be denoted with $0.1\\overline{23}$.\n\n\n\nThus rational numbers can be redefined as\n\nDecimal numbers that are terminating or recurring.\n\nI can convert terminating to fraction so I can prove first part of the statement but I can't prove the second yet.\n2.2 Adding and subtracting fractions\n\nOnly when there's a same denominator - fractions are of a same type.\nWhen there's different denominator - find common one (LCM).\nAlways simplify.\n\n2.3 Multiplying and dividing fractions\nMultiplying\n\nMultiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.\n\nDividing\n\nMultiple the fraction by its reciprocal \n\nReciprocal\nA number and its reciprocal multiply together to give 1.\nE.g.:\n$0.25 ~\\text{is rec of} ~4$,since $0.25 \\times 4 = 1$\n$\\frac{3}{2} ~\\text{is rec of} ~\\frac{2}{3}$,since $\\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 1$\nAlternatively, it is 1 divided by given number. \nTo find a reciprocal of fraction turn it upside down.\nE.g.:\n$\\text{rec of}~\\frac{3}{4}~\\text{is}~\\frac{4}{3}$\n2.4 Negative indices\nThe previous positive power of a number $n$ is equal to current positive power divided by $n$, e.g.:\n$4^3 = \\frac{4^4}{4}$\nThus $4^0$ has to be a number I get when dividing $\\frac{4^1}{4} = 1$.\nSimilarly $4^{-1}$ has to be a number I get when dividing $\\frac{4^0}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nWe can build whole scale of the pattern\n$4^{-3}$$4^{-2}$$4^{-1}$$4^0$$4^1$$4^2$$4^3$\n$\\frac{1}{4^3}$$\\frac{1}{4^2}$$\\frac{1}{4}$$1$$4$$16$$64$\n\nThe meaning of negative and zero indices works with all the index laws I've seen so far.\nIndex laws can be expand by following rules based on previous observations:\n\nA non-zero number raised to the power zero is 1:\n$$\na^0 = 1\n$$\nA non-zero number raised to a negative power is the reciprocal of the number raised to the corresponding positive power:\n$$\na^{n - 1} = \\frac{1}{a^n}\n$$\n\nInterestingly:\n$$\na^{-1} = \\frac{1}{a}\n$$\nHence, raising a number to the power of $-1$ is the same as finding its reciprocal.\nE.g.:\n$$\n(\\frac{2}{3})^{-1} = 1 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n2.5 Scientific notation\n\nAlso called standard form.\nA number between 1 and 10 (excluded) multiplied by a power of 10.\n\n3 Irrational numbers and real numbers\n3.1 What is an irrational number?\nDecimals with infinite number of digits afterthe decimal point but no repeating block of digits.\nFollowing number is not terminating nor recurring:\n$$\n0.010,010,001,000,010,000,01\\ldots\n$$\nTODO: What if the repeating block is just really big?\nHere $x$ is not rational:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 = 2 \\\\\n\\sqrt{2} = x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe fact that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational can be proven by contradiction followingly.\nSuppose there's a rational number whose square is $2$. Hence it can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{integer}}{\\text{integer}}\n$$\nConsider it being cancelled down to the simplest form as:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{n}\n$$\nSo $m$ and $n$ don't have any common factor.\nThe square of $\\frac{m}{n}$ is 2, so:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\frac{m}{n})^2 = 2 \\\\\n\\frac{m^2}{n^2} = 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIt follow that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{m^2}{n^2} \\times n^2 = 2 \\times n^2 \\\\\nm^2 = 2n^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n$2n^2$ has to be even since it's a product of 2 and whole number. Meaning $m^2$ has to be even too, that means $m$ has to be even as well.\nThat means that $m = 2r$ for some integer $r$.\nWhen substituting to the original equation we get:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(2r)^2 = 2n^2 \\\\\n4r^2 = 2n^2 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIt follow that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{4r^2}{2} = \\frac{2n^2}{2} \\\\\n2r^2 = n^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe integer $n^2$ is even hence $n$ has to be even too.\nSo both $m$ and $n$ are even. But that's impossible since $m$ and $n$ don't have any common factor.\n\nThe irrational numbers together with the rational numbers form the real numbers.\nI can think about various categories of numbers as layers:\nReal(\n\tIrrational,\n\tRational(\n\t\tIntegers(\n\t\t\tNatural\n\t\t)\n\t)\n)\n\nplus complex, that will come later on.\n3.2 Roots of numbers\nA number that when multiplied by itself gives the original number.\nEvery positive number has two square roots - a positive one and a negative one.\nSquare roots of two numbers can be used to find the square root of the product or a quotient.\nFor example, numbers 16 and 49 have square roots of 4 and 7.\nI can apply index law $(a \\times b)^n = a^n \\times b^n$ to those:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(4 \\times 7)^2 = 4^2 \\times 7^2 \\\\\n(4 \\times 7)^2 = 16 \\times 49\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThat implies:\n$$\n\\sqrt{16 \\times 49} = \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{49}\n$$\nThis can be generalized into following laws:\n$$\n\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} \\qquad \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}\n$$\nObviously, these laws apply to any root.\n3.3 Surds\nNumbers that are not perfect square have irrational roots. Hence following roots are irrational:\n$$\n\\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{8}, \\sqrt{10}, \\sqrt{11}\n$$\nSince such number can be only approximated as a decimal it should be left as is in calculations, e.g.:\n$$\nx = 2 \\times \\sqrt{5}\n$$\nsuch expressions are called surds - it contains one or more irrational roots of numbers.\nSurds are usually written concisely as formulas, number before surd when multiplied:\n$$\ny = 2\\sqrt{5}\n$$\nIn the simplest form:\n$$\n\\sqrt{12} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 3} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThis is obviously possible when some of a numbers under the root are perfect squares. Thus the goal when simplifying is to find some perfect square multiplied some other number giving the original number bellow the root.\nMultiplying roots\n\nMultiply numbers together\nMultiply roots together\nSimplify the root\n\nDividing roots\nUse following laws\n$$\n\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} \\qquad \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}\n$$\nSometimes, I should expand an integer to a multiplication of surds in order to simplify the quotient:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1 \\times \\sqrt{2}}{1} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nAdding and substracting roots\nIt's usually not possible to add or substract different roots, thus \n$$\n\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} \\not= \\sqrt{a + b}\n$$\nI can only add or substract roots that are the same.\n\nTo simplify surds\n\nSimplify roots of integers with square factors.\nSimplify products and quotients of roots.\nAdd or subtract roots that are the same.\n\n\n3.4 Fractional indices\nIndex laws can be applied to fractional indices too, e.g. let's consider the power $5^\\frac{1}{2}$\nBy applying\n$$\na^m \\times a^n = a ^{m + n}\n$$\nI get\n$$\n5^\\frac{1}{2} \\times 5^\\frac{1}{2} = 5^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}} = 5^1 = 5\n$$\nHence\n$$\n5^\\frac{1}{2} = \\sqrt{5}\n$$\nIt can be generalized in the following index law\n$$\na^\\frac{1}{n} = \\sqrt[n]{a}\n$$\nThis rule toegher with other index laws can be used to give a meaning to any fractional index.\nE.g. in combination with\n$$\n(a^m)^n = a^{mn}\n$$\nI can do following operation\n$$\n5^\\frac{4}{3} = 5^{\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4} = (5^{\\frac{1}{3}})^4 = (\\sqrt[3]{5})^4\n$$\nThis combination can be generalized to yet another index law\n$$\na^\\frac{m}{n} = (\\sqrt[n]{a})^m\n$$\nInterestingly the square root laws I saw before:\n$$\n\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} \\qquad \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}\n$$\nCan be deduced by applying $n = \\frac{1}{2}$ to following index laws:\n$$\n(a \\times b)^n = a^n \\times b^n \\qquad (\\frac{a}{b})^n = \\frac{a^n}{b^n}\n$$\n\nIrrational indices are also valid but I will encounter those later on.\n\n4 Ratios\n4.1 What is a ratio?\nComparition of multiple ordered quantities, e.g.: $3:5 ~ 2:10:7$\nSometimes it's useful to convert a ratio to a $number:1$ form to e.g.\n\nCompare multiple ratios.\nFind approximate ratios.\nTo reach such a form I can divide both numbers by second number, e.g.:\n$$\n7 : 11 = \\frac{7}{11} : \\frac{11}{11} = 0.636 : 1 ~\\text{(3 d.p.)}\n$$\n\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mu123-unit3/","title":"MU123 Unit 3 Notes"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mu123-unit4/":{"body":"1 Questions, questions\n\nQuantitative view - uses numbers -&gt;

Include the sign (plus or minus) at the start of each resulting term.\nCollect any like terms.\n\n\n\nStrategy\nTo remove brackets with a plus or minus sign in front\n\nInf the sign is plus, keep the sign of each term inside the brackets the same.\nIf the sign is minus, change the sign of each term inside the brackets.\n\n\n4.2 Algebraic fractions\nAre algebraic expressions written using fraction notation, e.g.: $a + \\frac{b}{c}$. Fractions are preffered over divisin sign.\nExpanding the algebraic fraction is useful technique when there is more terms in th numerator. such as:\n$$\n\\frac{2a - 5b + c}{3d}\n$$\nThe expresion can be rewritten as multiplication by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3d}(2a - 5b + c)\n$$\nThen I can multiply out the brackets:\n$$\n\\frac{2a}{3d} - \\frac{5b}{3d} + \\frac{c}{3d}\n$$\nOnce the algebraic fraction is expanded it may be possible to simplify some of the resulting terms.\n5 Linear equations\nParticularly linear equations in one unknown\nLinear because those equations doesn't include powers, e.g.: $x^2$, thus form straigh lines on a graph.\nAn equation consists of two expressions:\n\nleft-hand side (LHS)\nrigh-hand side (RHS)\n\nSolving the equation is the process of finding the value of the unknown. Found value is solution - solution satisfies the equation.\nAn equation can have more than one solution, e.g.: $a^2 = 4$ has two solutions - $a = 2$ and $a = -2$. Also an equation can have no solution at all, e.g.: $a^2 = -1$\n5.2 How to solve linear equation\n\nStrategy\n\ndo the same thing to both sides\nsimplify one side or both sides\nswap the sides\nclear any fraction and multiply out any brackets. To clear a fraction, multiply both sides by a suitable number.\nAdd or subtract terms on both sides to obtain an equation of the form $\\text{a number} \\times \\text{the unknown} = \\text{a number}$\n\n\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mu123-unit5/","title":"MU123 Unit 5 Notes"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mu123-unit6/":{"body":"Introduction\n\nExtends Unit 2 with connections between algebra and graphs.\nExplores relationships between two quantities.\nRelationships corresponding to straight lines only\n\n1 Plotting graphs\n\nUseful to illustrate an equation or formula with two variables\n\nFormula is an equation with a subject - a variable that appears by itself on one side of the equals sign and not at all on the other side.\n\n\n\n1.1 Graph axes and coordinates\n\nTwo axes - x and y.\nAeach axis has scale markings and arrows.\nDistance between two consecutive integers on an axis is reffered to as 1 unit.\nAxis are often extended to include negative numbers.\nEach point plottend on a graph is represented by the coordinates.\n\nFirst number represents position along the x-axis from 0\nSecond number position along the y-axis from 0\nThe two numbers are called x- and y-coordinates\nAlso known as the Cartesian coordinate system\nAlternatives labels (and units) can be used too\n\n\n\n1.2 Graphs of equations\nWhen an equation, e.g.: $y = \\frac{1}{2}x + 3$ is plotted into a line we say it's the equation of the line.\nChecking whether some coordinates lie on the line $y = \\frac{1}{2}x + 3$ is checking whether whether the coordinates of the point satisfy the equation.\nIn practical formulas, where variables are letters other than x and y the subject is known as the dependent variable. Its value depends on the value of th other, independent variable.\nIndpendent variable should be on the horizontal axis and the depenedent on the vertical - against the independent variable.\nIn the table of values, the indendent variable should be in the first line.\nRelationships plotted on straight line are called linear relationships.\n1.3 Scatterplots\nIs a graph plotted for two quantities for which I don't know an equation relating them. Plotted points are reffered to as data points.\nWhen data points approximatelly form a straight line it can be modelled into it. For which an equation can be devised.\n2 Characteristics of straight-line graphs\n2.1 Gradient\nMeasures the steepnes of a line. Gradient of the line is the number of units it moves vertically as it moves 1 unit horizontally to the right.\nGradient is often not obvious to find. One approach is to pick two points on the line and consider what happens when \"cursor\" is moved from left-hand point to the right-hand point.\nThe increase in the:\n\nx-coordinate is called run.\ny-coordinate is called rise.\n\nThe gradient of the line can be calculated by dividing the rise by the run:\n$$\n\\text{gradient} = \\frac{\\text{increase in y}}{\\text{increase in x}} = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\n$$\n\nThe sign of the gradient\nLines that slope up from left to right have a positive gradient.\nLines that slope down from left to right have a negative gradient.\n\nRun (x increase) and rise (y increase) can be calculated by subtracting the respective coordinate of the left-hand point from the respective coordinate of the right-hand point.\nSteepnes of a line depends not only on its gradient but also on the scales used on the axes.\nHorizontal and vertical lines\nThe gradient of every horizontal line is zero since the rise between any two points on a horizontal line is zero.\nThe gradient of every vertical line is undefined since the run is zero and it's not possible to divide any rise number by zero.\n2.2 A formula for gradient\nFirst point on the line can be represented as $(x_1, y_1)$ and second as $(x_2, y_2)$. 1, 2 are subscripts. Hence the gradient calculation can be generalised as:\n$$\n\\text{gradient} = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\nIt doesn't matter which point I take to be $(x_1, y_1)$ and which $(x_2, y_2)$\nParalel are such lines that never cross, even when extended infinitely. Hence those lines have to have the same gradient (except for vertical lines with undefined gradient).\n2.3 Interpreting gradients\nGradients for graphs that illustrate a relationship between real-life quantities should contain units in a form of y-unit / x-unit. When units are the same they cancel out so the gradient has no units.\nThe gradient can be thought of as the rate of change of y with respect to x.\nTo save time the units can be quoted in calculations e.g.:\n$$\n\\frac{150}{6} = 25~\\text{cm/day}\n$$\nThat is not strictly correct though.\n\nInterpreting the sign of the gradient of a graph\n\nA positive indicates that the quantity on the vertical axis increases as the quantity on the horizontal axis increases.\nA negative indicates that the quantity on the vertical axis decreases as the quantity on the horizontal axis increases.\nA zero indicates that the quantity on the vertical axis remains constant as the quantity on the horizontal axis increases.\n\n\n2.4 Intercepts\nThe value on the axis scale where a straight-line graph one of the graph axes.\nx-intercept is the value of x when y = 0 and the y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0.\n3 Equations of straight lines\n3.1 Lines that pass through the origin\nIn general, each line that passes through the origin has the equation:\n$$\ny = \\text{gradient} \\times x\n$$\nWith the exception of the vertical lines since it doesn't have a gradient.\nThe statement can be generalised as:\nThe straight line that passes through the origin and has gradient $m$ has equation $y = mx$.\n3.2 Direct proportion\nThe relationship between two quantities when, if one quantity is multiplied or divided by a number then the second quantity is also multiplied or divided by same number.\nE.g. number of miles is directly proportional to the equivalent number of kilometers.\nIf two quantities $x$ and $y$ are directly proportional to each other, then the relationship between them is described  by an equation of the form\n$$\ny = kx\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-zero number, known as the constant of proportionality.\nThe statement '$y$ is directly proportional to $x$' is sometimes written as\n$$\ny \\propto x\n$$\nConstant in an equation or expression is a quantity that doesn't change when the values of the variables change.\nA graph represents directly proportional quantities when it's a straight line through the origin. That means the constant of proprtionality is a gradient.\n3.3 The general equation of a straight line\nNearly every straight line graph can be described by an equation of the form\n$$\ny = mx + c\n$$\nwhere gradient $m$ and $y$-intercept $c$ are constants. The exeception being vertical lines.\nEquations of horizontal and vertical lines\nThe horizontal line with $y$-intercept $a$ has equation $y = a$.\nThe vertical line with $x$-interceept $a$ has equation $x = a$.\n3.4 Drawing lines from their equations\nWhen a graph illustrates an equation it should label the line.\n3.5 Finding the equations of lines\n\nFind the gradient $m$ of the line and substitute it into the general equation $y = mx + c$.\nSubstitute the coordinates of a point on the line into the equation of the line from step 1 and solve it fo find the value of the $y$-intercept $c$.\nUse the values of $m$ and $c$ to write down the equation of the line.\n\n4 Linear models from data\n4.1 Regression lines\nCollected data can be plotted on the graph and possibly modelled by straight line.\nThe way how a line fits the data can be meassured followingly:\n\nMeasure the vertical distances from the points to the line\nSquare each of these distances\nAdd up the squared distances\n\nThe smaller the sum the better the fit of the line. There is always just one line for which the sum is the smallest - the regression line.\nThe process of estimating a value within the range of the data is called interpolation.\nEstimating a value outside of the data range is called extrapolation and it can be unreliable. In general it is unwise to extrapolate too far from the range of dataset.\n4.2 Correlation coefficients\nMeasures how accurate a prediction provided by a regression line is likely to be. It's calcluated from data pair and denoted by $r$.\nIt indicates how well the regression line fits the data pairs.\nThe coefficient is always between -1 and 1, inclusive.\nWhen it's possitive the regression line has a positive gradient and it's called possitive correlation. Negative has a negative gradient and is called negative correlation.\nThe correlation coefficient is exactly 1 or exactly -1 when all the data points lie exactly on the regression line, it's called perfect correlation.\nStrong correlation is when the data points are close to the regression line.\nThe closer the coefficient is to zero the weaker is the correlation.\n","id":"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mu123-unit6/","title":"MU123 Unit 6 Notes"},"https://ktsk.xyz/docs/uni/mu123-unit9/":{"body":"1 Number patterns and algebra\n1.1 Arithmetic sequences\nSum of a sequence of natural numbers can be rewritten as a sum of pairs of numbers:\n$$\n1 + 2 + ... + 99 + 100 = (1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + ... + (50 + 51)\n$$\nThere are 50 pairs, each of them having a sum of $101$, so:\n$$\n1 + 2 + ... + 99 + 100 = 50 \\times 101 = 5050\n$$\nIn case of a sum of successive odd numbers the sum is always the square of how many odd numbers I add, e.g. $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4^2$ .
