        <h1>MST124 Unit 6 - Differentiation</h1>
        
        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Calculus allows to work with situations where a quantity is continuously changing and its rate of change isn't necessarily constant.</p>
<p>It applies to all situations where one quantity changes smoothly with respect to another quantity.</p>
<p>Basic calculus splits into </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>differential calculus</strong></li>
<li><strong>integral calculus</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="1-what-is-differentiation">1 What is differentiation?</h1>
<h2 id="1-1-graphs-of-relationships">1.1 Graphs of relationships</h2>
<p>If a graph that represents the relationship between two quantities is curved, then there's no single gradient value that applies to the whole graph.
Instead, the graph has a gradient at <em>each point</em> on the graph.</p>
<p>As with straight-line, the gradient at each point is the rate of change of the quantity on the vertical axis with respect to the quantity on the horizontal axis.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-gradients-of-curved-graphs">1.2 Gradients of curved graphs</h2>
<p>The gradient of straight line is a measure of how steep it is and is calculated as
$$
\text{gradient} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}
$$
Vertical lines don't have gradient. Hence:</p>
<h4 id="gradient-of-straight-line">Gradient of straight line</h4>
<p>The gradient of the straight line through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $x_1 \ne x_2$, is given by
$$
\text{gradient} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$</p>
<p>A straight-line graph that</p>
<ul>
<li>Slopes <em>down</em> from left to right has a <em>negative</em> gradient.</li>
<li>Is <em>horizontal</em> has a gradient of <em>zero</em>.</li>
<li>Slopes <em>up</em> from left to right has a <em>positive</em> gradient.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand curved graphs, as $y = x^2$ don't have a single gradient value. Instead, any particular point on it can be chosen and gradient can be found for the graph at that given point.</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif1.png" alt="dif1.png" /></p>
<p>The straight line that 'just touches' the graph at a given point is called the <strong>tangent</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>gradient</strong> of a graph at a particular point is the gradient of the tangent to the graph at that point.</p>
<p>If a graph has a 'sharp corner', like $y = |x|$ then it has no gradient at that point.
If a graph has a 'break' at a point (the <strong>discontinuity</strong>), then the graph has no tangent at that point, hence no gradient.
If a graph has a vertical tangent at a point, then the graph has no gradient at it.</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif2.png" alt="dif2.png" /></p>
<h2 id="1-3-gradients-of-the-graph-of-y-x-2">1.3 Gradients of the graph of $y = x^2$</h2>
<p>$y = x^2$ has a gradient at <em>every</em> point since it has a tangent, which is not vertical, at every point.</p>
<p>To find a gradient of a point on $y = x^2$ one may start by finding an <em>approximate</em> value by choosing a second point on the graph that is fairly close to first one. Then a gradient of this approximation can be calculated in usual way.</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif3.png" alt="dif3.png" /></p>
<p>The closer second point is to the first one, the better the approximation is.</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif4.png" alt="dif4.png" /></p>
<p>E.g. for point $(1, 1)$ and second point $(1.1, 1.21)$, the approximate value for the gradient is
$$
\frac{1.21 - 1}{1.1 - 1} = \frac{0.21}{0.1} = 2.1
$$
Second point can lie on both sides of first one.</p>
<p>Following table for $(1, 1)$ and various second points can be devised</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>$x$-coord of second point</th><th>0.8</th><th>0.9</th><th>0.99</th><th>0.999</th><th>1.001</th><th>1.01</th><th>1.1</th><th>1.2</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Gradient of line</td><td>1.8</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.99</td><td>1.999</td><td>2.001</td><td>2.01</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.2</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>That can be confirmed algebraically as follows.
Consider $h$ denoting the increase in the $x$-coordinate from $(1, 1)$ to the second point. The value of $h$ can't be zero.
The $x$-coordinate of second point is $1 + h$.
The $y$-coordinate of second point is $(1 + h)^2$.</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif5.png" alt="dif5.png" /></p>
<p>The gradient of the line that passes through both points is</p>
<p>$$
\begin{align*}
\text{gradient} &amp;= \frac{(1 + h)^2 - 1}{(1 + h) - 1} \\
&amp;= \frac{1 + 2h + h^2 - 1}{1 + h - 1} \\
&amp;= \frac{2h + h^2}{h} \\
&amp;= \frac{h(2 + h)}{h} \\
&amp;= 2 + h
\end{align*}
$$</p>
<p>As the value of $h$ gets closer and closer to zero, the gradient of the line $2 + h$ gets closer and closer to 2. Hence the gradient of the graph at $(1, 1)$ must bey exactly 2.</p>
<p>Expressed mathematically as</p>
<p>$2 + h$ <strong>tends</strong> to $2$ as $h$ <strong>tends</strong> to $0$</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>the <strong>limit</strong> of $2 + h$ as $h$ <strong>tends</strong> to zero is $2$.</p>
<p>More generic formula can be devised as</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif6.png" alt="dif6.png" /></p>
<p>$
\begin{align*}
\text{gradient} &amp;= \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{(x + h) - x} \\
&amp;= \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{x + h - x} \\
&amp;= \frac{2xh + h^2}{h} \\
&amp;= \frac{h(2x + h)}{h} \\
&amp;= 2x + h
\end{align*}$</p>
<p>As the second point gets closer and closer to the original point, the value of $h$ gets closer and closer to $0$ and the gradient gets closer and closer to $2x$.
So the gradient of the graph of $y = x^2$ at the point whose $x$-coordinate is denoted by $x$ is given by the formula
$$
\text{gradient} = 2x
$$</p>
<h2 id="1-4-derivatives">1.4 Derivatives</h2>
<p>Consider a function $f$ and input value $x$.
The point on the graph of $f$ that corresponds to $x$ is $(x, f(x))$.
If the graph of $f$ has a gradient at that point, then we say that $f$ is <strong>differentiable</strong> at $x$.</p>
<p>It's convenient to think about various gradients of a function $f$  as defining a new function that is related to $f$.
The rule of the new function is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the input value is $x$, then the output value is the gradient of the graph of $f$ at the point $(x, f(x))$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new function is called the <strong>derivative</strong> (or <strong>derived function</strong>) of the function $f$ and is denoted by $f'$.</p>
<p>The domain of $f'$ consists of all the values at which $f$ is differentiable.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation</strong> is the process of finding the derivative of a given function $f$.</p>
<p>The <em>value</em> of the derivative of a function $f$ at a particular input value $x$ is called the <strong>derivative of $f$ at $x$</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation-from-first-principle">Differentiation from first principle</h3>
<p>Suppose $f$ and $x$ in the domain of $f$ such that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ (the graph of $f$ has a gradient at $(x, f(x))$). Consider second point with the offset of $h$, then:</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif7.png" alt="dif7.png" /></p>
<p>The gradient of the  line that passes through the two points is given by
$$
\text{gradient} = \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{(x + h) - x} = \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
This expression is known as the <strong>difference quotient</strong> for the function $f$ at the value $x$.</p>
<p>As the value of $h$ gets closer and closer to zero, the value of the difference quotient gets closer and closer to the gradient of the graph at the point $(x, f(x))$, that is $f'(x)$.</p>
<p>To find the formula for $f'(x)$ I need to find, in terms of $x$, the <em>limit</em> of the difference quotient as $h$ tends to zero. In other words, I need to consider what happens to the difference quotient for $f$ at $x$, as $h$ gets closer and closer to zero.</p>
<p>Saying that a function $f$ is differentiable at a particular value of $x$ is the same as saying that the difference quotient for $f$ at $x$ tends to a limit as $h$ tends to zero. It must tend to the same limit for positive values of $h$ as for negative values.</p>
<p>For any function $f$, the derivative $f'$ of $f$ is given by the equation
$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ f(x + h) - f(x) }{ h }
$$
for each value of $x$ in the domain of $f$ for which this limit exists.</p>
<h3 id="leibniz-notation">Leibniz notation</h3>
<p>The notation with $f'$ denoting the derivative of a function $f$ is called <strong>Lagrange notation</strong> or <strong>prime notation</strong>. <strong>Leibniz notation</strong> is other extensively used notation.</p>
<p>In general, Lagrange notation is used when thinking in terms of a variable, and a function of this variable. Leibniz notation is used when thinking more of the relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>Consider $y = x^2$, formula for its gradient is $\text{gradient} = 2x$.
In Leibniz notation this equation is written as
$$
\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x} = 2x
$$
Often referred to as the <strong>derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$</strong>.</p>
<p>It's important to mention that</p>
<ul>
<li>The notation is not a fraction</li>
<li>$\text{d}$ doesn't have any meaning outside of the notation</li>
<li>$\text{d}$ is not a factor</li>
</ul>
<p>The usefulness of the Leibniz notation can be demonstrated as follows</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif8.png" alt="dif8.png" /></p>
<p>The emphasis is on the relationship between the variables $x$ and $y$, rather than on the idea of $f$ as a function of $x$.
Change in the $x$- and $y$-coordinate is denoted by $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ respectively. 
$\delta$ (delta) indicates 'a small change in'.
So the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of second point are $x + \delta x$ and $y + \delta y$ respectively.</p>
<p>The gradient of the line that passes through he two points is then
$$
\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}
$$</p>
<p>The gradient is the limit of $\delta y / \delta x$ as the second point gets closer and closer to the first point.</p>
<h3 id="functions-whose-domains-include-endpoints">Functions whose domains include endpoints</h3>
<p>Any function whose domain includes an endpoint isn't differentiable at this endpoint.
E.g. $f(x) = x^{3/2}$ has domain $[0, \infty)$:</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif9.png" alt="dif9.png" /></p>
<p>The endpoint at $0$ (at the origin) can be approached from right but can't from left. Hence the graph doesn't have tangent at the origin, it's not differentiable at $x = 0$.
But the graph has a 'gradient on the right' at origin, namely $0$.</p>
<p>So we can say that the function $f(x) = x^{3/2}$ is <strong>right-differentiable</strong> at $x=0$, and that its <strong>right derivative</strong> at 0 is 0.</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-derivatives">Summary of derivatives</h3>
<p>The <strong>derivative</strong> (or <strong>derived function</strong>) of a function $f$ is the function $f'$ such that
$$
f'(x) = \text{gradient of the graph of } f~ \text{at the point } (x, f(x))
$$
The domain of $f'$ consists of the values in the domain of $f$ at which $f$ is <strong>differentiable</strong> (that is, the $x$-values that give points at which the gradient exists).</p>
<p>If $y = f(x)$, then $f'(x)$ is also denoted by $\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}$.</p>
<p>The derivative $f'$ is given by the equation
$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ f(x + h) - f(x) }{ h }
$$
The procedure of using this equation to find a formula for the derivative $f'$ is called <strong>differentiation from first principles</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="2-1-derivatives-of-power-functions">2.1 Derivatives of power functions</h2>
<p>Any functions of the form $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a real number, is called a <strong>power function</strong>.</p>
<p>Previously seen formulas for the derivatives of three power functions are:
$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}(x^2) = 2x, ~~~
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}(x^3) = 3x^2, ~~~
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}(x^4) = 4x^3
$$
They all follow the same pattern:</p>
<h3 id="derivative-of-a-power-function">Derivative of a power function</h3>
<p>For any number $n$,
$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x}(x^n) = nx^{n -1}
$$
This formula holds for <em>all</em> values of $n$, including negative and fractional values.</p>
<p>$f(x) = x$  has derivative $f'(x) = 1 \times x^0$; that is$f'(x) = 1$.
$f(x) = 1$ (same as $f(x) = x^0$) has derivative $f'(x) = 0$.</p>

<h1 id="5-differentiating-twice">5 Differentiating twice</h1>
<h2 id="5-1-second-derivative">5.1 Second derivative</h2>
<p>The derivative of a function is itself a function, sometimes called the <em>derived function</em>. Meaning it can itself be differentiable.
The <strong>second derivative</strong> (or <strong>second derived function</strong>) is the function  that is obtained by differentiating a function twice.</p>
<p>In Lagrange notation, the second derivative of a function $f$ is denoted by $f''$.</p>
<p>In Leibniz notation, the second derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is denoted by:
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
$$
With following reasoning:
The second derivative can be written as
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{d}{dx}y)
$$
Which was historically abbreviated as
$$
(\frac{d}{dx})^2y~,\text{and then to}~~ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}
$$</p>
<p>The domain of the second derivative of a function consists of all the values of $x$ at which its first derivative is differentiable. It's said that the original function is <strong>twice-differentiable</strong> at such values of $x$.</p>
<p>Third, forth, Nth derivative can be taken in same way.</p>
<p>The derivative of a function is sometimes called its <strong>first derivative</strong>. Hence the word 'first' in 'first derivative test'.</p>
<p>Derivative of a function tells the gradient of the graph of the function. So the second derivative tells the gradient of the graph of the first derivative.
Hence the second derivative also gives an information about the shape of the graph of the original function.</p>
<p>E.g. suppose an interval on which the second derivative of a particular function is <em>positive</em>. 
By the increasing/decreasing criterion, this means that the first derivative is <em>increasing</em> on that interval. In other words, the gradient of the graph of the original function is increasing on that interval.</p>
<p>Meaning that the shape of the graph of the original function on the interval must be something like:</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif15.png" alt="dif15.png" /></p>
<p>All of these are sections of the graphs with increasing gradient.</p>
<p>A section of a graph shaped like one of the diagrams above is said to be <em>concave up</em>.
A graph is <strong>concave up</strong> on an interval if the tangents to the graph on that interval lie <em>below</em> the graph:</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif16.png" alt="dif16.png" /></p>
<p>When there is an interval on which the second derivative of a particular function is <em>negative</em> then, by the increasing/decreasing criterion, the first derivative is <em>decreasing</em> on that interval. Meaning the shape of the graph of the original function on the interval must be something like:</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif17.png" alt="dif17.png" /></p>
<p>A section of a graph shaped like this is said to be <em>concave down</em>.
A graph is <strong>concave down</strong> on an interval if the tangents to the graph on that interval lie <em>above</em> the graph:</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif18.png" alt="dif18.png" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, the words <em>convex</em> and <em>concave</em> are used instead of concave up and concave down, respectively.</p>
<p>A point where a graph changes from concave up to concave down or vice versa is called a <strong>point of inflection</strong>. E.g. $f(x) = x^3$ has a point of inflection at the origin:</p>
<p><img src="/mst124_u6_data/dif19.png" alt="dif19.png" /></p>
<p>If the gradient of a graph at a point of inflection is zero, then the point is a <strong>horizontal</strong> point of inflection. Otherwise the point is a <strong>slant</strong> point of inflection.</p>
<h3 id="concave-up-concave-down-criterion">Concave up/concave down criterion</h3>
<p>If $f''(x)$ is positive for all $x$ in an interval $I$, then $f$ is concave up on $I$.
If $f''(x)$ is negative for all $x$ in an interval $I$, then $f$ is concave down on $I$.</p>
<h3 id="second-derivative-test-for-determining-the-nature-of-a-stationary-point">Second derivative test (for determining the nature of a stationary point)</h3>
<p>If, at a stationary point of a function, the value of the second derivative of the function is</p>
<ul>
<li>negative, then the stationary point is a local maximum</li>
<li>positive, then the stationary point is a local minimum</li>
</ul>
<p>When the value of the second derivative at a stationary point is <em>zero</em> then I can't use the second derivative test to determine the nature of the stationary point.</p>
