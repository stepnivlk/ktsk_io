        <h1>MST124 Unit 3 - Functions</h1>
        
        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Whenever one quantity depends on another, we say that the first quantity is a <strong>function</strong> of the second quantity.</p>
<h1 id="1-functions-and-their-graphs">1 Functions and their graphs</h1>
<h2 id="1-1-sets-of-real-numbers">1.1 Sets of real numbers</h2>
<p>A <strong>set</strong> is a collection of objects. The objects could be anything at all.
An <strong>element</strong> or <strong>member</strong> is each of the objects in a set.
Elements of the set <strong>belong to</strong> or are <strong>in</strong> a set.</p>
<p>A set can be specified by enclosing a list of elements in curly brackets, e.g.:
$$
S = {5, 12, 34, 58}
$$</p>
<p>A set can be described, e.g.:
Let $T$ be the set of all odd integers.
Sets are usually denoted with capital letters.</p>
<p><strong>Empty set</strong> is denoted with $
\emptyset$.
$\in$ means is in and $\notin$ means is not in.</p>
<p>An <strong>intersection</strong> is a process of forming new set out of overlapping members of two or more sets and is denoted as $A \cap B$.</p>
<p><strong>Union</strong> is a process of forming new set out of all the members of two or more sets and is denoted as $A \cup B$.</p>
<p>$A$ is a <strong>subset</strong> of $B$ when every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. A subset is denoted as $A \subseteq B$.
Every set is a subset of itself and the empty set is a subset of every set.</p>
<p>The set of all real number is denoted as $\mathbb{R}$.</p>
<p>An <strong>interval</strong> is a set of real numbers that correspond to a continuous section of number line.</p>
<p>An <strong>endpoint</strong> is a number that lies at the end of an interval.
The whole set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is an interval with no endpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Closed</strong> is such interval that includes all of its endpoints.
<strong>Open</strong> interval doesn't include any of its endpoints.
<strong>Half-open</strong> interval includes only one of its endpoints.</p>
<p>$\mathbb{R}$ doesn't have endpoints, so it's both open and closed.</p>
<p><strong>Inequality signs</strong> can be used to describe intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Interval notation</strong> can also describe intervals e.g.:
$$
4 \le x &lt; 7
$$
is denoted as:
$$
[4, 7)
$$</p>
<p>An interval that extends indefinitely is denoted by $\infty$ or $-\infty$.</p>
<p>Union of intervals can be described as e.g.:
$$
(-\infty, 2] \cup [4, 6)
$$</p>
<h2 id="1-2-what-is-a-function">1.2 What is a function?</h2>
<p>A <strong>function</strong> consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a set of allowed input values, called the <strong>domain</strong> of the function</li>
<li>a set of values in which every output value lies, called the <strong>codomain</strong> of the function</li>
<li>a process, called the <strong>rule</strong> of the function, for converting each input value into <em>exactly one</em> output value.</li>
</ul>
<p>A function can be denoted with <strong>function notation</strong>, e.g.:
$$
h(x) = x^2
$$</p>
<p>The <strong>image set</strong> is a set of values in the codomain that <em>do</em> occur as output values.</p>
<p>Every value in the domain of a function must have <em>exactly one</em> output value.</p>
<p>If $f$ is a function, and $x$ is any value in its domain, then the value $f(x)$ is called the <strong>image of</strong> $x$ <strong>under</strong> $f$, or the <strong>value of</strong> $f$ <strong>at</strong> $x$, or $f$ <strong>maps</strong> $x$ to $f$.</p>
<p><strong>Real functions</strong> have domain and codomain consisting of real numbers.</p>
<h2 id="1-3-specifying-functions">1.3 Specifying functions</h2>
<p>Function specification consists of its domain and rule, e.g.:
$$
f(x) = x^{2}+ 1 ~~ (0 \le x \le 6)
$$
or</p>
<p>$$
f(x) = x^{2}+ 1 ~~ (x \in [0, 6])
$$</p>
<p>When a function is specified by <em>just a rule</em>, it's understood that the domain of the function is the largest possible set of real numbers for which the rule is applicable.</p>
<h2 id="1-4-graphs-of-functions">1.4 Graphs of functions</h2>
<p>is the set of points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane such that $x$ is in the domain of $f$ and $y = f(x)$.</p>
<h3 id="functions-increasing-or-decreasing-on-an-interval">Functions increasing or decreasing on an interval</h3>
<p>A function $f$ is <strong>increasing on the interval</strong> $I$ if for all values $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$ such that $x_1 &lt; x_2$,
$$
f(x_1) &lt; f(x_2)
$$</p>
<p>A function $f$ is <strong>decreasing on the interval</strong> $I$ if for all values $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$ such that $x_1 &lt; x_2$,
$$
f(x_1) &gt; f(x_2)
$$
(The interval $I$ must be part of the domain of $f$.)</p>
<h2 id="1-5-image-sets-of-functions">1.5 Image sets of functions</h2>
<p>In the same way as a domain of function can be visualized on the $x$-axis the image set of a function can be visualized on the $y$-axis.</p>
<p>The image set consists of all the possible output numbers, that is, all the points on the $y$-axis that lie directly to the right or left of a point on the graph.</p>
<h2 id="1-6-some-standard-types-of-functions">1.6 Some standard types of functions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear functions</strong> - has the rule of the form $f(x) = mx + c$.</li>
<li><strong>Constant function</strong> - a linear function whose rule is of the form $f(x) = c$.</li>
<li><strong>Quadratic functions</strong> - has the rule of the form $f(x) = ax^{2} + bx + c$.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="polynomial-functions">Polynomial functions</h3>
<p>Linear and quadratic functions are particular types of polynomial functions. Other example of polynomial function is:
$$
f(x) = 2x^{4} - 5x^{3} + x^{2} + 2x - 3
$$</p>
<p>In general, a <strong>polynomial expression in $x$</strong> is any expression that is a sum of finitely many terms, each of which is of the form $ax^{n}$ where $a$ is a number and $n$ is a non-negative integer.</p>
<p><strong>Degree</strong> of a polynomial expression or function is the highest power of the variable $x$ in it.</p>
<p>Quadratic functions are polynomial functions of degree 2.</p>
<p>Linear functions are polynomial functions of degree 1, 0 or no degree at all.</p>
<p>Polynomial functions of degrees 3, 4, and 5 are called</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cubic</strong></li>
<li><strong>quartic</strong></li>
<li><strong>quintic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>functions, respectively</p>
<p>Every polynomial function (with domain $\mathbb{R}$) that isn't a constant function <strong>tends to infinity</strong> or <strong>tends to minus infinity</strong> at the left and right.</p>
<p><strong>Dominant term</strong> is a term in a rule of function with the highest power of $x$ and it defines whether the function tends to infinity or minus infinity. It's called dominant because it outweights (<em>dominates</em>) the sum of the values taken by all other temrs for large values of $x$.</p>
<p>If the dominant term has a plus sign and</p>
<ul>
<li>contains an even power of $x$, then the graph tends to infinity at both ends.</li>
<li>contains an odd power of $x$, then the graph tends to minus infinity at the left and to infinity at the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dominant term has a minus sign and</p>
<ul>
<li>contains an even power of $x$, then the graph tends to minus infinity at both ends.</li>
<li>contains an odd power of $x$, then the graph tends to infinity at the left and to minus infinity at the right.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-modulus-function">The modulus function</h3>
<p>The <strong>modulus</strong> of a real number (or <strong>magnitude</strong>, <strong>absolute value</strong>) is its 'distance from zero' and for a real number $x$ its denoted as  $|x|$.</p>
<p>THe modulus function is
$$
f(x) = |x|
$$</p>
<p>It follows form the definition that
$$
\begin{equation*}
|x| = \begin{cases}
x \quad &amp;\text{if} , x \ge 0 \

<p>If a curve has a property when it gets <em>arbitrarily close</em> to straight line as it gets further away from origin then the straight line is called the <strong>asymptote</strong> of the curve.</p>

<p>Suppose that $f$ is a function and $c$ is a constant. To obtain the graph of:</p>
<ul>
<li>$y = f(x) + c$, translate the graph of $y = f(x)$ up by $c$ units (the translation is down if $c$ is negative)</li>
<li>$y = f(x - c)$, translate the graph of $y = f(x)$ to the right by $c$ units (the translation is to the left if $c$ is negative).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/mst124_u2_data/translation_fnc.png" alt="translation_fnc.png" /></p>
<p>A translations can be combined. An equation $y = f(x)$ can be moved $c$ units to the right by replacing $x$ as $y = f(x - c)$. A shift up can be achieved by adding a constant $d$:
$$
y = f(x - c) + d
